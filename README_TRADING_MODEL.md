# RLlib Trading Model Improvement and Paper Trading

This document outlines the process for iteratively improving the RLlib trading model and setting up paper trading with Interactive Brokers.

## Overview

The project consists of three main components:

1. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: A framework for systematically exploring different model configurations to improve performance metrics.
2. **Model Evaluation**: A comprehensive evaluation system to assess model performance on test data and compare against benchmark strategies.
3. **Paper Trading Integration**: A system to export the best model and use it for paper trading with Interactive Brokers.

## Iterative Model Improvement Process

### 1. Hyperparameter Optimization (`hyperparameter_optimization.py`)

This script implements a systematic approach to optimize the trading model by:

- Running multiple training runs with different hyperparameter configurations
- Evaluating each model based on key metrics (PnL, Sharpe ratio, drawdown, win rate)
- Selecting the best configuration for further refinement
- Providing visualization of the optimization results

The hyperparameter search space includes:

- **Environment parameters**: transaction fees, window sizes, penalties, risk fractions
- **Model architecture**: network sizes, activation functions
- **Training parameters**: learning rates, batch sizes, discount factors

To run hyperparameter optimization:

```bash
python hyperparameter_optimization.py
```

The results will be saved in the `./optimization_results` directory, and the best model will be saved in the `./best_models` directory.

### 2. Model Evaluation (`model_evaluation.py`)

This script provides a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance on test data:

- Evaluates the model on recent market data
- Calculates key performance metrics (PnL, Sharpe ratio, drawdown, win rate)
- Compares against benchmark strategies (Buy and Hold, Moving Average Crossover)
- Visualizes performance through various plots

To evaluate a model:

```bash
python model_evaluation.py
```

The evaluation results will be saved in the `./evaluation_results` directory.

### 3. Model Export for Paper Trading (`export_for_paper_trading.py`)

This script exports the best model for paper trading with Interactive Brokers:

- Loads the best model from hyperparameter optimization
- Exports it in a format suitable for inference
- Creates a configuration file for the paper trading system
- Sets up the basic structure for Interactive Brokers integration

To export a model for paper trading:

```bash
python export_for_paper_trading.py
```

The exported model and paper trading scripts will be saved in the `./paper_trading` directory.

## Paper Trading Setup

### Prerequisites

1. Interactive Brokers account with paper trading enabled
2. Interactive Brokers Trader Workstation (TWS) or IB Gateway installed and running
3. Python packages: `ibapi`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `torch`, `ta`

### Configuration

Edit the `./paper_trading/paper_trading_config.json` file to configure:

- Interactive Brokers connection parameters
- Trading parameters (symbol, risk per trade, max position size, etc.)
- Trading hours and days
- Logging and monitoring settings

### Running Paper Trading

1. Start Interactive Brokers TWS or IB Gateway
2. Enable API connections in TWS/Gateway settings
3. Run the paper trading script:

```bash
python ./paper_trading/paper_trading.py --model-dir ./paper_trading/models/model_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
```

The script will:
- Connect to Interactive Brokers
- Fetch market data at regular intervals
- Make trading decisions based on the model's predictions
- Execute trades in the paper trading account
- Log performance and trades

## Improvement Strategies

To iteratively improve the model's performance, consider:

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Run multiple hyperparameter optimization rounds, focusing on promising regions of the parameter space.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Add new technical indicators or alternative data sources that might improve prediction accuracy.

3. **Reward Function Engineering**: Modify the reward function to better align with trading objectives (e.g., emphasize risk-adjusted returns).

4. **Model Architecture Exploration**: Try different neural network architectures (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) to better capture temporal patterns.

5. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models to improve robustness and reduce overfitting.

6. **Risk Management**: Implement more sophisticated risk management rules in the trading system.

7. **Market Regime Detection**: Add mechanisms to detect and adapt to different market regimes (trending, mean-reverting, volatile).

## Monitoring and Evaluation

Regularly evaluate the model's performance in paper trading:

1. Compare actual performance against backtest results
2. Analyze trade patterns and success rates
3. Monitor drawdowns and risk metrics
4. Adjust parameters based on real-world performance

Only move to live trading once the model has demonstrated consistent positive performance in paper trading over an extended period.
