# ReinforceStrategyCreator Pipeline

Production-grade modular model pipeline for reinforcement learning trading strategies.

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive pipeline for training, evaluating, and deploying reinforcement learning models for trading strategies. It transforms the existing test harness into a robust, maintainable pipeline suitable for production use and paper trading.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with dedicated components for data management, model training, evaluation, and deployment
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Integrated support for Ray Tune and Optuna
- **Cross-Validation**: Robust model selection with multiple metrics
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking with Datadog integration
- **Deployment Ready**: Support for paper trading and live deployment
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new models, data sources, and evaluation metrics

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the package:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```python
from pipeline.orchestrator import ModelPipeline

# Run the pipeline with default configuration
pipeline = ModelPipeline(config_path="configs/base/pipeline.yaml")
pipeline.run()
```

## Configuration

The pipeline uses a hierarchical configuration system. Base configurations are in `configs/base/`, with environment-specific overrides in `configs/environments/`.

## Development

To install development dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Run tests:
```bash
pytest tests/
```
