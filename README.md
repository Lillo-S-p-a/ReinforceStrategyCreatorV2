## About the Project üéØ

ReinforceStrategyCreator is a Python project designed to develop, train, and evaluate reinforcement learning (RL) agents for creating automated trading strategies. It leverages technical analysis indicators as inputs for the RL agent, aiming to discover profitable patterns and automate the complex process of strategy generation and backtesting.

The primary goal is to provide a flexible framework where different RL algorithms and technical indicators can be experimented with to build robust trading bots.

## Key Features ‚ú®

*   **Flexible RL Environment:** Built using `gymnasium`, allowing easy integration with standard RL algorithms and libraries.
*   **Technical Analysis Integration:** Seamlessly incorporates various technical indicators (using libraries like `pandas-ta` and `ta`) into the agent's observation space.
*   **Data Fetching:** Includes utilities to fetch historical market data (e.g., using `yfinance`).
*   **Agent Implementation:** Designed to work with RL agents (e.g., using `tensorflow`), enabling training and evaluation.
*   **Backtesting Capability:** The environment inherently supports backtesting strategies by simulating trades on historical data.
*   **Transaction Cost Simulation:** Accounts for transaction fees for more realistic performance evaluation.

## Tech Stack/Built With üíª

*   [Python](https://www.python.org/) (>= 3.12)
*   [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management
*   [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) for the RL environment core
*   [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for building and training RL agents
*   [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data manipulation
*   [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for numerical operations
*   [pandas-ta](https://github.com/twopirllc/pandas-ta) & [ta](https://github.com/bukosabino/ta) for technical indicators
*   [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance) for fetching stock data
*   [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for HTTP requests

## Getting Started üöÄ

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

*   **Python:** Version 3.12 or higher. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
*   **Poetry:** A dependency management tool. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
*   **Git:** To clone the repository.
*   **(Potentially OS-Specific):** Some technical analysis libraries (like the base `TA-Lib` which `ta` might wrap) can have specific system dependencies (e.g., build tools). Check the documentation for `ta` or `TA-Lib` if you encounter installation issues related to it. `pandas-ta` is often easier to install.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/ReinforceStrategyCreator.git # Replace with actual URL
    cd ReinforceStrategyCreator
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies using Poetry:**
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
    This command creates a virtual environment and installs all the required packages listed in `pyproject.toml`.

## Usage Examples üí°

Here's a conceptual example of how to use the trading environment:

```python
import pandas as pd
from reinforcestrategycreator.data_fetcher import fetch_data # Assuming fetch_data exists
from reinforcestrategycreator.technical_analyzer import calculate_indicators # Assuming calculate_indicators exists
from reinforcestrategycreator.trading_environment import TradingEnv
# from reinforcestrategycreator.rl_agent import YourAgent # Assuming an agent class exists

# 1. Fetch Data
# Replace 'AAPL', 'start_date', 'end_date' with actual values
raw_data = fetch_data('AAPL', '2020-01-01', '2023-12-31')

# 2. Calculate Indicators
# Ensure your calculate_indicators function adds columns to the DataFrame
data_with_indicators = calculate_indicators(raw_data)

# 3. Initialize Environment
# Make sure the DataFrame passed includes the necessary price columns ('close')
# and the calculated indicator columns.
env = TradingEnv(df=data_with_indicators, initial_balance=10000, window_size=10)

# 4. (Conceptual) Training Loop
# agent = YourAgent(env.observation_space, env.action_space) # Initialize your agent
#
# episodes = 100
# for episode in range(episodes):
#     obs, info = env.reset()
#     done = False
#     truncated = False
#     total_reward = 0
#     while not done and not truncated:
#         action = agent.predict(obs) # Agent decides action
#         obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
#         agent.learn(obs, reward, terminated, truncated) # Agent learns
#         total_reward += reward
#         done = terminated or truncated
#     print(f"Episode {episode + 1}: Total Reward: {total_reward}, Final Portfolio Value: {info.get('portfolio_value')}")

# env.close() # Close the environment if needed
```

*Note: The training loop is conceptual. You'll need to implement or use an existing RL agent compatible with Gymnasium and TensorFlow (or your chosen RL library like Stable-Baselines3 if you adapt the project).*
