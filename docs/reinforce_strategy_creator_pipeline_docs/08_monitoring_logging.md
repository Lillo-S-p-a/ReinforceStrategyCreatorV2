# 8. Monitoring and Logging (`src/monitoring/`)

Robust monitoring and logging are essential for understanding pipeline behavior, diagnosing issues, and tracking performance over time. The pipeline includes capabilities for both local logging and integration with external monitoring services. The relevant code is likely in `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/monitoring/`.

### 8.1. Logging Framework (`src/monitoring/logger.py`)
The pipeline likely employs a standardized logging framework, potentially centered around a `logger.py` module within `src/monitoring/`. This framework would be responsible for:
*   **Configurable Log Levels:** Allowing users to set the desired verbosity of logs (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) via the `monitoring.log_level` parameter in `pipeline.yaml`.
*   **Structured Logging:** Optionally logging messages in a structured format (e.g., JSON) to facilitate easier parsing and analysis by log management systems.
*   **Consistent Log Formatting:** Ensuring all log messages across different pipeline components share a consistent format, including timestamps, module names, and severity levels.
*   **Output Destinations:** Directing logs to standard output/error, local files (e.g., within the `logs/` directory mentioned in the project structure), and/or external monitoring services.

The `training.log_dir` in `pipeline.yaml` also specifies a directory for training-specific logs, including TensorBoard logs if `training.use_tensorboard` is enabled.

### 8.2. Datadog Integration
The pipeline supports integration with Datadog for advanced monitoring and observability, as configured in the `monitoring` section of `pipeline.yaml`.
*   **Enabling Integration:** Monitoring is enabled if `monitoring.enabled` is `true`.
*   **Credentials:** Datadog API and Application keys (`monitoring.datadog_api_key`, `monitoring.datadog_app_key`) are required, typically supplied via environment variables for security.
*   **Key Metrics Pushed:** The pipeline can be configured to push various key metrics to Datadog, such as:
    *   Pipeline execution status (success, failure).
    *   Duration of pipeline runs and individual stages.
    *   Model performance metrics from the Evaluation Stage (e.g., Sharpe ratio, total return).
    *   Resource utilization (CPU, memory) if instrumented.
    *   Error rates and exception counts.
*   **Metrics Prefix:** The `monitoring.metrics_prefix` (e.g., `"model_pipeline"`) is used to namespace metrics within Datadog, making them easier to find and dashboard.
*   **Dashboards and Alerts:** Once metrics are in Datadog, users can create custom dashboards to visualize pipeline health and performance, and set up alerts based on predefined thresholds.

### 8.3. Alerting Mechanisms
Alerting is a key aspect of proactive monitoring. The pipeline can trigger alerts based on:
*   **Datadog Alerts:** The `monitoring.alert_thresholds` section in `pipeline.yaml` defines thresholds for specific metrics (e.g., `sharpe_ratio_min: 0.5`, `max_drawdown_max: 0.2`, `error_rate_max: 0.05`). If these thresholds are breached, alerts can be configured within Datadog to notify the relevant teams (e.g., via email, Slack, PagerDuty).
*   **Internal Alerts:** The pipeline might also have internal mechanisms to raise critical errors or failures that halt execution and log detailed error messages.
