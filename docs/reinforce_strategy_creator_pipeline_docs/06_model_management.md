# 6. Model Management

Effective management of reinforcement learning models is crucial for experimentation, reproducibility, and deployment. The pipeline incorporates components and conventions for handling model implementations and their instantiation.

### 6.1. Model Implementations (`src/models/`)
The source code for different RL agent implementations (e.g., DQN, PPO, A2C) resides in the `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/models/implementations/` directory (based on the project structure and common practice, though the architect outline points to `src/models/`). Each model type typically has its own module or set of files defining its architecture, forward pass, and learning algorithm specifics.

This modular structure allows for:
*   Clear separation of model-specific logic.
*   Easier debugging and maintenance of individual models.
*   Straightforward addition of new RL algorithms by creating new modules within this directory.

### 6.2. Model Factory (`src/models/factory.py`)
To dynamically select and instantiate the desired RL model based on the pipeline configuration, a Model Factory pattern is commonly used. The architect's outline suggests the presence of `src/models/factory.py`.

The responsibilities of a Model Factory typically include:
*   **Model Registration:** Maintaining a registry of available model types (e.g., mapping the string "DQN" from `model.model_type` in `pipeline.yaml` to the actual DQN model class).
*   **Dynamic Instantiation:** Given a `model_type` string and a dictionary of `model.hyperparameters` from the configuration, the factory creates an instance of the corresponding model class.
*   **Decoupling:** The factory decouples the `TrainingStage` (or other components that need a model) from the concrete model implementations. This means the `TrainingStage` doesn't need to know the specifics of each model class; it just requests a model of a certain type from the factory.

This approach enhances flexibility, making it simple to switch between different RL algorithms by merely changing the `model.model_type` in `pipeline.yaml`, provided the new model is registered with the factory and adheres to a common interface expected by the training engine. The "Potential Areas for Further Deep-Dive/Ambiguity" section in the architect's outline notes the need to detail specifics of the `ModelFactory` and how custom models are registered and instantiated.
