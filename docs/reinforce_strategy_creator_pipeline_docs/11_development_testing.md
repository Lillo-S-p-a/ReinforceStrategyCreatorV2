# 11. Development and Testing

This section provides guidance for developers working on the ReinforceStrategyCreator Pipeline, including setting up the development environment and running tests.

### 11.1. Setting up Development Environment
As outlined in the "Installation" section (and the project's `README.md`), setting up a development environment involves:
1.  **Cloning the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline
    ```
2.  **Creating a Virtual Environment:** It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python projects.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Installing Dependencies:** Install the package in editable mode (`-e`) along with development-specific dependencies (often defined as an extra in `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`, e.g., `[dev]`).
    ```bash
    pip install -e ".[dev]"
    ```
    The `[dev]` extra typically includes tools for testing (like `pytest`), linting (like `flake8`, `pylint`), formatting (like `black`, `isort`), and pre-commit hooks.

### 11.2. Running Tests
The pipeline includes a test suite to ensure code quality and correctness. The tests are likely located in the `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/tests/` directory.
*   **Running All Tests:** To execute the entire test suite, use `pytest` (assuming it's the chosen test runner and installed via the `[dev]` dependencies):
    ```bash
    pytest tests/
    ```
*   **Running Specific Tests:** `pytest` allows for running specific test files, classes, or methods:
    ```bash
    pytest tests/integration/test_pipeline_flow.py  # Run all tests in a specific file
    pytest tests/unit/test_data_manager.py::TestDataManager::test_load_csv # Run a specific test method
    ```
*   **Test Coverage:** Consider using tools like `pytest-cov` to measure test coverage and identify untested parts of the codebase.
*   **Types of Tests:** The `tests/` directory might be structured to include:
    *   `unit/`: Unit tests for individual modules and functions.
    *   `integration/`: Integration tests verifying interactions between components (e.g., how different pipeline stages work together).
    *   `e2e/` (End-to-End): Tests that run the entire pipeline with sample data to ensure the overall workflow is correct.

Maintaining a comprehensive test suite and running tests regularly is crucial for robust development and refactoring.
