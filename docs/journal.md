# ReinforceStrategyCreator - Development Journal

## 2025-04-29

*   **Task:** Establish Foundational Documentation
    *   **Action:** Created initial `docs/architecture.md` outlining project goal, core components (:ComponentRole), and high-level interaction flow.
    *   **Action:** Created initial `docs/requirements.md` detailing functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements, including SAPPO context where applicable.
    *   **Action:** Created this `docs/journal.md` to track progress.
    *   **Status:** Completed.

*   **Task:** Refine Trading Environment Action Space (Req FR3.3)
    *   **Component:** `reinforcestrategycreator/trading_environment.py` (:ComponentRole TradingEnvironment)
    *   **Context:** :Context RLCore
    *   **Action:** Modified `TradingEnv` action space from {Hold, Buy, Sell} to {Flat (0), Long (1), Short (2)}.
    *   **Action:** Added `self.current_position` state tracking.
    *   **Action:** Rewrote `_execute_trade_action` to handle transitions between Flat, Long, and Short states, including transaction costs (:TransactionCost) and negative share handling for short positions. Addressed potential :LogicError in transitions.
    *   **Testing:** Updated tests in `tests/test_trading_environment.py` and `tests/test_trading_env_step.py` to reflect the new action space and verify transitions, portfolio updates, and fee application (**Targeted Testing Strategy**: Core Logic + Contextual Integration). Ensured reward calculation returns `float`.
    *   **Status:** Completed. All relevant tests passing.

*   **Task:** Define Next Steps
    *   **Action:** Proposed phased plan (Phase 3: Env Realism, Phase 4: Agent Logic, Phase 5: Integration).
    *   **Decision:** User requested creation of foundational documentation before proceeding with implementation phases.
    *   **Status:** Documentation created. Awaiting user decision on the next implementation phase/task.
*   **Task:** Implement Sharpe Ratio Reward (Req FR3.7, FR3.8)
    *   **Component:** `reinforcestrategycreator/trading_environment.py` (:ComponentRole TradingEnvironment)
    *   **Context:** :Context RLCore, :Context RewardShaping, :RiskAdjustedReturn
    *   **Action:** Modified `TradingEnv.__init__` to accept `sharpe_window_size` and initialize `_portfolio_value_history` (deque).
    *   **Action:** Modified `TradingEnv.reset` to clear `_portfolio_value_history`.
    *   **Action:** Modified `TradingEnv.step` to update `_portfolio_value_history` and call `_calculate_reward`.
    *   **Action:** Implemented `TradingEnv._calculate_reward` using Sharpe Ratio calculation. Handled potential division by zero (:NumericalInstability) by returning 0 reward if standard deviation of returns is zero.
    *   **Testing:** Updated relevant tests in `tests/test_trading_environment.py` and `tests/test_trading_env_step.py` to verify the new reward calculation under various conditions (**Targeted Testing Strategy**: Core Logic + Contextual Integration).
    *   **Status:** Completed. All relevant tests passing. Requirements FR3.7 updated, FR3.8 marked implemented.
*   **Task:** Test RLAgent Learn Method Core Logic (Req FR4.1, FR4.3)
    *   **Component:** `reinforcestrategycreator/rl_agent.py` (:ComponentRole RLAgent), `tests/test_rl_agent.py`
    *   **Context:** :Context RLCore, :Context ModelTraining, :Algorithm DQN, :Algorithm ExperienceReplay
    *   **Action:** Added `gamma` hyperparameter to `StrategyAgent.__init__`.
    *   **Action:** Implemented core `learn` method logic: sampling batch, predicting Q-values for next/current states, calculating Bellman target, constructing target Q-array, calling `model.fit`.
    *   **Testing:** Implemented `test_init_gamma` and `test_learn_q_value_target_calculation_and_fit` in `tests/test_rl_agent.py`. Used extensive mocking (`unittest.mock`) for `model.predict` and `model.fit`. Verified correct arguments passed to mocks, handling shuffled batch order. Verified Bellman target calculation. Updated `test_learn_integration_no_runtime_error`. (**Targeted Testing Strategy**: Core Logic + Contextual Integration).
    *   **Status:** Completed. All relevant tests passing.

*   **Task:** Debug Database Logging for RLlib Callbacks
    *   **Initial Context:** Investigating why episode data (final portfolio value, PnL, etc.) was not being saved correctly to the database via `reinforcestrategycreator/callbacks.py`. Initial attempts focused on `on_episode_end` not being called or data access issues within the callback.
    *   **Critical Update:** User revealed that the project recently migrated from **TensorFlow to PyTorch**. This significantly changes the context, as RLlib's API and internal object structures (like the `episode` object passed to callbacks) can differ.
    *   **Decision:** The issue is likely broader than a simple callback fix and requires a more comprehensive refactor of the RLlib integration, especially concerning how callbacks interact with the PyTorch backend and RLlib's new API stack.
    *   **Action:** Will create an MDTM task to delegate this refactoring work to `dev-solver`.
    *   **Status:** Investigation pivoted; new refactoring task to be created.
