# ReinforceStrategyCreator - Requirements

This document outlines the key functional and non-functional requirements for the ReinforceStrategyCreator project.

## 1. Functional Requirements

*   **FR1: Data Acquisition**
    *   FR1.1: The system MUST be able to fetch historical market data (OHLCV - Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) for specified financial instruments (:DataSource).
    *   FR1.2: Support fetching data from local CSV files.
    *   FR1.3: (Future) Support fetching data from specific financial data APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage).
*   **FR2: Feature Engineering**
    *   FR2.1: The system MUST calculate standard technical indicators (:FeatureEngineering) based on the fetched market data.
    *   FR2.2: MUST include at least RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands.
    *   FR2.3: The calculation MUST handle initial NaN values appropriately.
*   **FR3: Trading Simulation Environment**
    *   FR3.1: The system MUST provide a trading environment (:ComponentRole TradingEnvironment) compliant with the Gymnasium API standard.
    *   FR3.2: The environment MUST use the fetched data and calculated indicators as part of its state representation (:Context RLCore).
    *   FR3.3: The environment's action space MUST be discrete, representing {Flat (0), Long (1), Short (2)} positions (:Context RLCore). (Implemented - Req 2.3)
    *   FR3.4: The environment MUST simulate trade execution based on agent actions, updating portfolio balance and shares held (allowing negative shares for short positions).
    *   FR3.5: The environment MUST apply a configurable transaction fee (:TransactionCost) for buy and sell operations.
    *   FR3.6: (Future) The environment SHOULD simulate market slippage (:Slippage).
    *   FR3.7: The environment MUST calculate a reward signal based on portfolio performance changes.
    *   FR3.8: (Future) The reward calculation SHOULD incorporate risk-adjusted metrics (:RiskAdjustedReturn, e.g., Sharpe Ratio).
*   **FR4: Reinforcement Learning Agent**
    *   FR4.1: The system MUST include an RL agent (:ComponentRole RLAgent) capable of learning a trading policy.
    *   FR4.2: The agent MUST interact with the Trading Environment using the standard observation-action-reward loop.
    *   FR4.3: The agent MUST implement a recognized RL algorithm (:Algorithm RL, e.g., DQN, PPO).
    *   FR4.4: The agent's hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, exploration rate, etc.) MUST be configurable.
*   **FR5: Strategy Backtesting (Future)**
    *   FR5.1: The system MUST provide a mechanism to evaluate the trained agent's policy on unseen historical data (:DataSource ValidationSet).
    *   FR5.2: The backtester MUST calculate standard performance metrics (:Metric, e.g., Total Return, Max Drawdown, Sharpe Ratio).
*   **FR6: Reporting (Future)**
    *   FR6.1: The system SHOULD present backtesting results clearly.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR1: Modularity:** The system components (Data Fetcher, Analyzer, Environment, Agent) MUST be modular and loosely coupled.
*   **NFR2: Testability:** All core logic within components MUST be unit-testable. The interaction between components MUST be integration-testable. Follow a **Targeted Testing Strategy** (Core Logic + Contextual Integration).
*   **NFR3: Configurability:** Key parameters (data source, indicators, agent hyperparameters, fees) MUST be configurable.
*   **NFR4: Code Quality:** Code MUST adhere to PEP 8 standards and include type hinting.
