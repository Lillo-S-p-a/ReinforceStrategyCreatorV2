# ReinforceStrategyCreator - System Architecture

## 1. Project Goal

To develop a system (`ReinforceStrategyCreator`) that utilizes Reinforcement Learning (RL) to discover and evaluate potentially profitable trading strategies based on historical market data and technical indicators.

## 2. Core Components (:ComponentRole)

The system is designed with a modular architecture, comprising the following core components:

*   **Data Fetcher (`data_fetcher.py`):**
    *   **Role:** :ComponentRole DataAcquisition
    *   **Responsibility:** Acquiring historical market data (:DataSource) from specified sources (e.g., CSV files, APIs).
    *   **Context:** :Context DataPipeline

*   **Technical Analyzer (`technical_analyzer.py`):**
    *   **Role:** :ComponentRole FeatureEngineering
    *   **Responsibility:** Calculating relevant technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) from the raw market data.
    *   **Context:** :Context DataPipeline, :Context RLFeaturePreparation

*   **Trading Environment (`trading_environment.py`):**
    *   **Role:** :ComponentRole TradingEnvironment
    *   **Responsibility:** Simulating the trading process based on market data and agent actions. Provides observations, executes trades (long, short, flat), calculates portfolio value, applies transaction costs/slippage (future), and computes rewards. Adheres to the Gymnasium API standard.
    *   **Context:** :Context RLCore, :Context Simulation

*   **RL Agent (`rl_agent.py`):**
    *   **Role:** :ComponentRole RLAgent
    *   **Responsibility:** The core learning component. It observes the environment state, selects actions based on its learned policy (:Algorithm RL - e.g., DQN, PPO), and updates its policy based on the rewards received.
    *   **Context:** :Context RLCore

*   **Strategy Backtester (Future Component):**
    *   **Role:** :ComponentRole ValidationFramework
    *   **Responsibility:** Evaluating the performance of the agent's learned policy on unseen historical data (:DataSource ValidationSet) using various performance metrics (:Metric).
    *   **Context:** :Context StrategyEvaluation

*   **User Interface / Reporting (Future Component):**
    *   **Role:** :ComponentRole Visualization, :ComponentRole Reporting
    *   **Responsibility:** Presenting the backtesting results, strategy performance metrics, and potentially visualizing trades or agent behavior.
    *   **Context:** :Context UserInteraction

## 3. High-Level Interaction Flow

1.  **Data Fetcher** retrieves historical data.
2.  **Technical Analyzer** processes the data to add indicator features.
3.  The processed data is fed into the **Trading Environment**.
4.  The **RL Agent** interacts with the **Trading Environment** in a loop:
    *   Env provides an observation.
    *   Agent selects an action (Long, Short, Flat).
    *   Env executes the action, updates its state, and calculates a reward.
    *   Env provides the next observation and reward to the Agent.
    *   Agent learns from the experience (observation, action, reward, next observation).
5.  (Future) Once trained, the Agent's policy is evaluated by the **Strategy Backtester**.
6.  (Future) Results are presented via the **User Interface / Reporting** component.
