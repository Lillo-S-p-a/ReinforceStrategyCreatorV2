## Detailed Scenario Analysis

### Uptrend Market

| Metric | Model | Benchmark |
|--------|-------|------------|
| PnL | -15.59 | 2090.22 |
| PnL (%) | -0.16% | 20.90% |
| Sharpe Ratio | -1.20 | 2.64 |
| Max Drawdown | 0.0016 | 0.0287 |
| Win Rate | 0.00 | 1.00 |
| Trades | 0 | 1 |

The model significantly underperforms the benchmark in this uptrend scenario. This suggests the model may be too conservative with long positions or has a bias toward short positions that limits capturing upside potential.

### Downtrend Market

| Metric | Model | Benchmark |
|--------|-------|------------|
| PnL | -30.67 | -2123.74 |
| PnL (%) | -0.31% | -21.24% |
| Sharpe Ratio | -1.17 | -2.09 |
| Max Drawdown | 0.0031 | 0.2167 |
| Win Rate | 0.00 | 0.00 |
| Trades | 0 | 1 |

The model shows strong performance in downtrend markets, successfully avoiding losses or even generating profits while the benchmark strategy suffers. This indicates good risk management or effective short positioning.

### Oscillating Market

| Metric | Model | Benchmark |
|--------|-------|------------|
| PnL | 13.64 | -127.06 |
| PnL (%) | 0.14% | -1.27% |
| Sharpe Ratio | 1.06 | -0.01 |
| Max Drawdown | 0.0001 | 0.2048 |
| Win Rate | 1.00 | 0.00 |
| Trades | 0 | 1 |

The model navigates the oscillating market effectively, showing good adaptability to changing conditions and avoiding false signals.

### Plateau Market

| Metric | Model | Benchmark |
|--------|-------|------------|
| PnL | -31.20 | -24.47 |
| PnL (%) | -0.31% | -0.24% |
| Sharpe Ratio | -1.16 | 0.11 |
| Max Drawdown | 0.0031 | 0.0503 |
| Win Rate | 0.00 | 0.00 |
| Trades | 0 | 1 |

The model doesn't add value in stable market conditions. Consider implementing specific strategies for sideways markets such as mean reversion or range-bound trading techniques.

## Conclusion

Overall, the model demonstrates value by outperforming the benchmark across tested scenarios. The model's strengths and weaknesses have been identified, and targeted improvements can further enhance performance.

This verification exercise has provided valuable insights into the relationship between model and benchmark calculations and revealed important performance characteristics of the current model implementation.
