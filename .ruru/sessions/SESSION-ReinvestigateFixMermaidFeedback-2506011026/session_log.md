# Session Log: Re-investigate and fix Mermaid diagrams in docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md based on new feedback

## Goal
The primary goal of this session is to re-investigate all Mermaid diagrams within the document [`docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md`](docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md), based on new user feedback indicating errors, identify any syntax errors, and correct them to ensure proper rendering.

## Log Entries
*   2025-06-01 10:26:43Z: Session initiated by `roo-commander` with goal: "Re-investigate and fix Mermaid diagrams in docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md based on new feedback". Session ID: `SESSION-ReinvestigateFixMermaidFeedback-2506011026`. This session is a follow-up to `SESSION-FixMermaidNonExperts-2506011021` due to new user feedback.
*   2025-06-01 10:27:39Z: Created MDTM task [`TASK-UWRT-250601102700-ReFixMermaidDiagramsFeedback.md`](.ruru/tasks/UTIL_WRITER/TASK-UWRT-250601102700-ReFixMermaidDiagramsFeedback.md) for `util-writer` to re-investigate and fix Mermaid diagrams in [`docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md`](docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md) based on new user feedback.
- 2025-06-01 10:30:00: `util-writer` completed MDTM task [`TASK-UWRT-250601102700-ReFixMermaidDiagramsFeedback.md`](.ruru/tasks/UTIL_WRITER/TASK-UWRT-250601102700-ReFixMermaidDiagramsFeedback.md). Investigation of [`docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md`](docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md) revealed no Mermaid diagram errors. The document already reflects the correct diagrams. Task status updated to "üü¢ Done".
*   2025-06-01 10:30:40Z: Received completion signal from `util-writer` for task [`TASK-UWRT-250601102700-ReFixMermaidDiagramsFeedback.md`](.ruru/tasks/UTIL_WRITER/TASK-UWRT-250601102700-ReFixMermaidDiagramsFeedback.md). Specialist reported again that no errors were found in the Mermaid diagrams. This conflicts with user-provided visual evidence of an error.
*   2025-06-01 10:31:23Z: Read file [`docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md`](docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md).
*   2025-06-01 10:31:23Z: Compared current content of the first diagram (lines 33-52) with the user-provided image. The diagram in the file *matches the corrected version* shown in the user's image. The error message in the image seems to describe a *previous state* of the diagram.
*   2025-06-01 10:31:23Z: The second diagram (lines 83-112) also appears syntactically correct in the current file content.
*   2025-06-01 10:31:56Z: Roo Commander direct review of [`docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md`](docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md) found no errors in Mermaid diagrams. The diagram from user's error image appears to have been corrected in the current file version.
*   2025-06-01 10:31:56Z: Session `SESSION-ReinvestigateFixMermaidFeedback-2506011026` completed. No further action taken on the document as it appears correct.
- **2025-06-01 23:58:35**: `dev-python` completed E2E test for `DeploymentStage` in `full_cycle_pipeline` (Task `TASK-DEVPY-20250601-231230`). Pipeline executed successfully, `DeploymentStage` triggered paper trading logic as verified by logs. Noted that paper trading data source is not yet configured, which is expected for this test. MDTM task checklist updated.
-   `[2025-06-02T09:55:28+02:00]` `dev-python`: Completed code changes for MDTM task `TASK-DEVPY-20250602-094500-IntegrateMonitoringService.md`.
    -   Integrated `MonitoringService` into `ModelPipeline` orchestrator ([`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/pipeline/orchestrator.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/pipeline/orchestrator.py)).
    -   Updated `DataIngestionStage` ([`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/pipeline/stages/data_ingestion.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/pipeline/stages/data_ingestion.py)) to use `MonitoringService`.
    -   Updated `FeatureEngineeringStage` ([`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/pipeline/stages/feature_engineering.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/pipeline/stages/feature_engineering.py)) to use `MonitoringService`.
    -   Updated `TrainingStage` ([`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/pipeline/stages/training.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/pipeline/stages/training.py)) to use `MonitoringService`.
    -   Updated `EvaluationStage` ([`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/pipeline/stages/evaluation.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/pipeline/stages/evaluation.py)) to use `MonitoringService`.
    -   Updated `DeploymentStage` ([`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/pipeline/stages/deployment.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/pipeline/stages/deployment.py)) to use `MonitoringService`.
    -   Updated MDTM task checklist and status to "üü† In Progress".
    -   Next step: E2E testing of the `full_cycle_pipeline` by the coordinator.
