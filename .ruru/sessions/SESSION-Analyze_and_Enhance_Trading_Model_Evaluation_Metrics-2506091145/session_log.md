## Log Entries

- [2025-06-09 11:46:02] Session initiated by `roo-commander` with goal: "Analyze and Enhance Trading Model Evaluation Metrics"
**[2025-06-09 11:50:30]** Started analysis of current TensorBoard metrics flow from DQN model to HPO runs. Key findings:

1. **Current metrics flow**: DQN.train() ‚Üí TrainingEngine ‚Üí HPOptimizer._create_trainable() ‚Üí tune.report() ‚Üí TensorBoard
2. **Current metrics reported**: Only basic RL metrics (`loss`, `val_loss`, `epoch`, `final_loss`, `min_loss`)
3. **Available trading metrics**: MetricsCalculator class has comprehensive trading metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, Max Drawdown, Win Rate, etc.)
4. **Gap identified**: DQN model tracks trading logic but doesn't calculate/report trading-specific metrics

Next: Define required trading-specific metrics list and implement calculation logic in DQN model.
**[2025-06-09 11:52:30]** ‚úÖ **Completed MDTM checklist item #2**: Defined comprehensive list of required trading-specific metrics
- Added detailed metrics specification to MDTM task file
- Categorized metrics into: Core Performance, Risk, Trading Activity, Advanced Performance, and Drawdown Analysis
- Identified 20+ specific metrics available from MetricsCalculator class
- Documented implementation notes for TensorBoard integration
- **Next step**: Implement calculation logic for new metrics in [`dqn.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/models/implementations/dqn.py)
- [2025-06-09 11:53:30] Received update from util-senior-dev on task TASK-SRDEV-250609114800. Metrics analysis complete, list of required trading metrics defined. Specialist proceeding with implementation in dqn.py.
- [2025-06-09 14:58:42] Created MDTM task TASK-WRITER-250609125800 for util-writer to document implemented trading metrics in Italian.
- [2025-06-09 15:41:26] Delegated task TASK-WRITER-250609125800 to util-writer. Task is currently blocked pending completion of TASK-SRDEV-250609114800.
- [2025-06-09 16:56:06] Re-assigned MDTM task TASK-SRDEV-250609114800 from util-senior-dev to dev-python for specialized Python and ML implementation.
- 2025-06-09 15:41:00 - `util-writer` (`TASK-WRITER-250609125800`): Task status updated to "‚ö™ Blocked" due to dependency on `TASK-SRDEV-250609114800` ("Enhance Trading Model Evaluation Metrics for TensorBoard") which is currently "üü† In Progress". Waiting for coordinator's instruction to proceed or for dependent task completion.
**[2025-06-09 17:04:22]** `dev-python` completed implementation of trading metrics calculation logic in DQN model:
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive metrics calculation at end of each episode using MetricsCalculator
- ‚úÖ Implemented portfolio value tracking and trade recording throughout training loop
- ‚úÖ Added error handling for metrics calculation failures with NaN fallbacks
- ‚úÖ All 25+ trading metrics now stored in training_history dictionary
- ‚úÖ Updated MDTM task checklist items: "Implement calculation logic" and "Add metrics to training_history"
- Modified: [`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/models/implementations/dqn.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/models/implementations/dqn.py)

- `[2025-06-10T06:36:00Z]` RooCommander: User provided listing for `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/hpo_results/dqn/dqn_hpo_quick_test/`. Identified that previous TensorBoard `--logdir` path was incorrect. It was specified as `./hpo_results/...` assuming execution from workspace root, but the `hpo_results` directory is nested within `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline`. Corrected path relative to workspace root is `./reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/hpo_results/dqn/dqn_hpo_quick_test/`. Will attempt to relaunch TensorBoard with this corrected path.
- `[2025-06-10T06:39:00Z]` RooCommander: User confirmed TensorBoard still not showing detailed financial metrics with the corrected logdir. User provided image showing some Ray Tune default metrics. User asked about sufficiency of current 25+ metrics and requested enhancement of [`.ruru/docs/trading_metrics_explained_it.md`](./.ruru/docs/trading_metrics_explained_it.md) to include interpretation of values and correlation to trading performance.
- `[2025-06-10T06:39:00Z]` RooCommander: Plan:
    1. Acknowledge TensorBoard issue, pivot to user's new questions.
    2. Discuss metric sufficiency via `ask_followup_question`.
    3. Create MDTM task for `util-writer` to enhance documentation.
- `[2025-06-10T06:46:00Z]` RooCommander: User provided a list of 10 RL-specific metrics to be logged to TensorBoard (Episode Reward, Episode Length, Loss types, Entropy, Learning Rate, Value Estimates, TD Error, KL Divergence, Explained Variance, Success Rate).
- `[2025-06-10T06:46:00Z]` RooCommander: User also requested enhancement of [`.ruru/docs/trading_metrics_explained_it.md`](./.ruru/docs/trading_metrics_explained_it.md) to include detailed interpretation of existing financial metrics and to add documentation for the new RL metrics (once implemented).
- `[2025-06-10T06:46:00Z]` RooCommander: Plan:
    1. Create MDTM task for `dev-python` to implement logging of the 10 new RL-specific metrics.
    2. Create MDTM task for `util-writer` to enhance existing financial metrics documentation and add documentation for the new RL metrics (dependent on completion of RL metrics implementation).
- 2025-06-10T08:44:54Z - util-writer: Completed MDTM task [`TASK-WRITER-250610084100`](./.ruru/tasks/METRICS_DOCUMENTATION/TASK-WRITER-250610084100.md:1). Enhanced existing financial metrics documentation and added new documentation for RL-specific metrics in [`.ruru/docs/trading_metrics_explained_it.md`](./.ruru/docs/trading_metrics_explained_it.md:1).
- `[2025-06-10T08:46:00Z]` RooCommander: Received confirmation from `dev-python` that MDTM task [`TASK-PYDEV-250610064700`](./.ruru/tasks/RL_METRICS_IMPLEMENTATION/TASK-PYDEV-250610064700.md) (Implement 10 RL-specific metrics) is complete. Changes were made to [`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/models/implementations/dqn.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/models/implementations/dqn.py).
- `[2025-06-10T08:46:00Z]` RooCommander: Received confirmation from `util-writer` that MDTM task [`TASK-WRITER-250610084100`](./.ruru/tasks/METRICS_DOCUMENTATION/TASK-WRITER-250610084100.md) (Enhance Trading & RL Metrics Documentation) is complete. Changes were made to [`.ruru/docs/trading_metrics_explained_it.md`](./.ruru/docs/trading_metrics_explained_it.md).
- `[2025-06-10T08:46:00Z]` RooCommander: All planned tasks for enhancing trading model evaluation metrics and documentation are now complete. Preparing to finalize and attempt completion.
- `[2025-06-10T08:47:00Z]` RooCommander: The `attempt_completion` tool failed with a VSCE output error: "Error: VSCE output start escape sequence (]633;C or ]133;C) not received, but the stream has started. Upstream VSCE Bug?". Despite this tool error, the specialist modes have reported completion of their assigned tasks for metrics implementation and documentation. Proceeding to provide commit message and git command.
- `[2025-06-10T10:10:00Z]` RooCommander: User confirmed Git push was successful. User now requests to run the pipeline and check TensorBoard for the new metrics.
- `[2025-06-10T10:10:00Z]` RooCommander: Plan:
    1. Execute the HPO script `run_hpo_dqn.py` with the "quick_test" preset to generate new logs.
    2. After completion, instruct the user on the new TensorBoard command pointing to the specific run directory.
- `[2025-06-10T10:47:00Z]` RooCommander: HPO script execution failed with `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'config'` in [`hpo_optimizer.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/training/hpo_optimizer.py:369). This indicates Ray Tune could not find the best trial, likely due to a mismatch or absence of the "loss" metric in trial results.
- `[2025-06-10T10:47:00Z]` RooCommander: Plan:
    1. Create MDTM task for `dev-python` to debug and fix the metric reporting/retrieval in `HPOptimizer` and its `trainable` function.
- 2025-06-10 17:44:00: Received completion from `dev-python` for task [`TASK-PYDEV-250610104800`](./.ruru/tasks/HPO_DEBUG/TASK-PYDEV-250610104800.md). HPO `AttributeError` fixed. Root cause: metric name mismatch (`episode_reward_mean` vs `episode_reward`). File [`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/examples/run_hpo_dqn.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/examples/run_hpo_dqn.py) was modified.
- 2025-06-10 18:55:00: User confirmed they will run `python reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/examples/run_hpo_dqn.py --config-name quick_test` and then `tensorboard --logdir ./reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/hpo_results/dqn/dqn_hpo_quick_test/` to verify metrics visibility. Awaiting results.
- 2025-06-10 19:09:00: User ran HPO script `python reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/examples/run_hpo_dqn.py --config-name quick_test`.
- 2025-06-10 19:09:00: HPO script failed with `ImportError: cannot import name 'get_factory' from partially initialized module 'src.models.factory'` due to a circular import. Affected files include [`factory.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/models/factory.py), [`dqn.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/models/implementations/dqn.py), [`metrics.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/evaluation/metrics.py), [`engine.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/evaluation/engine.py), and [`registry.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/models/registry.py).
- 2025-06-10 21:16:00: Received completion from `dev-python` for task [`TASK-PYDEV-250610191000`](.ruru/tasks/CIRCULAR_IMPORT_FIX/TASK-PYDEV-250610191000.md). Circular import error resolved by implementing lazy import in [`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/models/implementations/dqn.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/models/implementations/dqn.py).
- 2025-06-10 21:16:00: New issue identified: HPO script runs past model registration but `analysis.get_best_trial()` in [`hpo_optimizer.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/training/hpo_optimizer.py) still returns `None`, indicating Ray Tune trials are not completing successfully or not reporting the optimization metric correctly.
