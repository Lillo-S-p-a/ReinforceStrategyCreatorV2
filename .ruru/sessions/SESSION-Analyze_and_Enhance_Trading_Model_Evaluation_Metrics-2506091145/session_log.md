## Log Entries

- [2025-06-09 11:46:02] Session initiated by `roo-commander` with goal: "Analyze and Enhance Trading Model Evaluation Metrics"
**[2025-06-09 11:50:30]** Started analysis of current TensorBoard metrics flow from DQN model to HPO runs. Key findings:

1. **Current metrics flow**: DQN.train() ‚Üí TrainingEngine ‚Üí HPOptimizer._create_trainable() ‚Üí tune.report() ‚Üí TensorBoard
2. **Current metrics reported**: Only basic RL metrics (`loss`, `val_loss`, `epoch`, `final_loss`, `min_loss`)
3. **Available trading metrics**: MetricsCalculator class has comprehensive trading metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, Max Drawdown, Win Rate, etc.)
4. **Gap identified**: DQN model tracks trading logic but doesn't calculate/report trading-specific metrics

Next: Define required trading-specific metrics list and implement calculation logic in DQN model.
**[2025-06-09 11:52:30]** ‚úÖ **Completed MDTM checklist item #2**: Defined comprehensive list of required trading-specific metrics
- Added detailed metrics specification to MDTM task file
- Categorized metrics into: Core Performance, Risk, Trading Activity, Advanced Performance, and Drawdown Analysis
- Identified 20+ specific metrics available from MetricsCalculator class
- Documented implementation notes for TensorBoard integration
- **Next step**: Implement calculation logic for new metrics in [`dqn.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/models/implementations/dqn.py)
- [2025-06-09 11:53:30] Received update from util-senior-dev on task TASK-SRDEV-250609114800. Metrics analysis complete, list of required trading metrics defined. Specialist proceeding with implementation in dqn.py.
- [2025-06-09 14:58:42] Created MDTM task TASK-WRITER-250609125800 for util-writer to document implemented trading metrics in Italian.
- [2025-06-09 15:41:26] Delegated task TASK-WRITER-250609125800 to util-writer. Task is currently blocked pending completion of TASK-SRDEV-250609114800.
- [2025-06-09 16:56:06] Re-assigned MDTM task TASK-SRDEV-250609114800 from util-senior-dev to dev-python for specialized Python and ML implementation.
- 2025-06-09 15:41:00 - `util-writer` (`TASK-WRITER-250609125800`): Task status updated to "‚ö™ Blocked" due to dependency on `TASK-SRDEV-250609114800` ("Enhance Trading Model Evaluation Metrics for TensorBoard") which is currently "üü† In Progress". Waiting for coordinator's instruction to proceed or for dependent task completion.
**[2025-06-09 17:04:22]** `dev-python` completed implementation of trading metrics calculation logic in DQN model:
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive metrics calculation at end of each episode using MetricsCalculator
- ‚úÖ Implemented portfolio value tracking and trade recording throughout training loop
- ‚úÖ Added error handling for metrics calculation failures with NaN fallbacks
- ‚úÖ All 25+ trading metrics now stored in training_history dictionary
- ‚úÖ Updated MDTM task checklist items: "Implement calculation logic" and "Add metrics to training_history"
- Modified: [`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/models/implementations/dqn.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/models/implementations/dqn.py)
- Next: Verify metrics flow through Ray Tune and test implementation
