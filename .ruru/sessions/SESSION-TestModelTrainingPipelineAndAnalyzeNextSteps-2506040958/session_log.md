# Session Log V7

*This section is primarily for **append-only** logging of significant events by the Coordinator and involved modes.*
*Refer to `.ruru/docs/standards/session_artifact_guidelines_v1.md` for artifact types and naming.*

## Log Entries

- [2025-06-04 09:59:00] Session initiated by `roo-commander` with goal: "Test model training pipeline and analyze next steps"
- [2025-06-04 10:08:00] Executing pipeline tests after development environment setup.
- [2025-06-04 10:09:00] `pytest` execution completed with 135 failed tests and 15 errors.
- [2025-06-04 10:11:36] Saved full `pytest` output to `artifacts/docs/pytest_output_2506041009.txt`.
- [2025-06-04 10:12:57] Created MDTM task `TASK-FIX-20250604-101200` for pytest failure analysis and assigned to `dev-fixer`. Path: `.ruru/tasks/BUG_PytestFailures_Pipeline/TASK-FIX-20250604-101200.md`
*   [2025-06-04 10:14:35] `dev-fixer` analyzed `pytest_output_2506041009.txt` for task `TASK-FIX-20250604-101200`. Identified 15 errors and 135 failures. Key patterns:
    *   **Errors (15):** `TypeError` instantiating abstract `MockModel` in `tests/unit/test_cross_validator.py`.
    *   **Failures (Key Patterns):**
        *   `RuntimeError: ConfigManager not found` in pipeline context for various stages.
        *   `TypeError: ...__init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'name'` for `DeploymentStage`.
        *   `AttributeError: <PipelineStage(name='...')> does not have the attribute '...'` in multiple stages.
        *   `TypeError` related to `LocalFileSystemStore` method signature changes.
        *   `ValueError: Unknown model type '...'` in `ModelFactory` and `ModelRegistry` tests.
        *   `FileNotFoundError` in `ModelCheckpointCallback` when saving state.
        *   `ModelPipelineError` in `tests/unit/test_pipeline/test_orchestrator.py` due to issues loading pipeline definitions/stages.
    *   Plan is to address these systematically, starting with `MockModel` `TypeError`.
