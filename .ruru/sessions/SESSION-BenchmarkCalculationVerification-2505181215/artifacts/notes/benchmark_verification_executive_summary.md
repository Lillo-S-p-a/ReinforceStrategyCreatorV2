# Executive Summary: Benchmark Calculation Verification

## Problem Statement

The backtesting system showed a suspicious discrepancy between the model performance metrics (40.79% PnL, 6.18 Sharpe ratio) and benchmark performance metrics (negative values for both Buy and Hold and SMA strategies). This raised concerns about the validity of the benchmark calculations and the overall reliability of the backtesting comparison.

## Investigation Findings

Our comprehensive code analysis of the backtesting system revealed several potential issues in the benchmark calculation implementation:

1. **Implementation Differences**: 
   - Unnecessary list conversion in the Buy and Hold strategy
   - Inconsistent application of transaction fees
   - Different approaches to portfolio value tracking

2. **Calculation Method Variations**:
   - Different approaches to metrics calculation
   - Inconsistent handling of data normalization
   - Potential differences in trade execution logic

3. **Data Consistency Issues**:
   - The model uses normalized data through a window approach
   - Benchmarks use raw price data
   - Lack of validation to ensure consistent data processing

## Solutions Implemented

We've created two key tools to address these issues:

1. **Verification Script** (`benchmark_verification_script.py`):
   - Generates controlled test data with known patterns
   - Runs both model and benchmarks on identical data
   - Performs manual calculations as a ground truth reference
   - Creates visual comparisons of portfolio value progression
   - Quantifies differences between implementation methods

2. **Fix Application Script** (`apply_benchmark_fixes.py`):
   - Removes unnecessary list conversion
   - Ensures consistent transaction fee handling
   - Enhances portfolio value tracking
   - Standardizes metrics calculation
   - Adds validation to the benchmark comparison workflow

## Action Plan

A detailed action plan (`benchmark_verification_action_plan.md`) has been created that outlines a step-by-step process to:

1. Establish baseline metrics using the verification script
2. Apply the identified fixes
3. Verify the effectiveness of the fixes
4. Run the full backtesting workflow with improved benchmarks
5. Update documentation to reflect changes

## Expected Impact

These changes will:

- Ensure fair and accurate comparisons between model and benchmark performance
- Increase confidence in the backtesting results
- Provide more reliable benchmarks for evaluating model improvements
- Enable more informed decision-making based on backtesting data

## Next Steps

After implementing and verifying these fixes, consider:

1. Adding more comprehensive regression testing for the backtesting system
2. Implementing additional benchmark strategies to provide broader performance context
3. Enhancing visualization of model vs benchmark performance for clearer interpretation
4. Adding more validation steps to prevent similar issues in future development
