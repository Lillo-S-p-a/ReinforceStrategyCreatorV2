# Benchmark Verification Action Plan

## Overview

Based on our comprehensive analysis of the benchmark calculation system, we've identified several key issues that may be causing the discrepancy between the model and benchmark performance metrics. This document outlines a structured plan to verify and fix these issues.

## Key Issues Identified

1. **List Conversion Issue**: Unnecessary conversion of price data to a list in the Buy and Hold strategy, potentially causing overhead and precision loss.
2. **Inconsistent Fee Handling**: Potential differences in how transaction fees are applied between model and benchmark implementations.
3. **Portfolio Value Tracking Variance**: The model tracks portfolio values differently than benchmarks, affecting metrics calculation.
4. **Different Metrics Calculation**: Subtle differences in how metrics like Sharpe ratio and drawdowns are calculated.
5. **Data Consistency Issues**: Benchmarks and model potentially operate on slightly different data representations.

## Action Plan

### Phase 1: Initial Verification

1. Run the verification script to establish baseline comparison:
   ```bash
   python .ruru/sessions/SESSION-BenchmarkCalculationVerification-2505181215/artifacts/notes/benchmark_verification_script.py
   ```
   
2. Document the differences found in metrics calculation on synthetic data.

### Phase 2: Apply Fixes

1. Apply the fixes using the fix application script:
   ```bash
   python .ruru/sessions/SESSION-BenchmarkCalculationVerification-2505181215/artifacts/notes/apply_benchmark_fixes.py
   ```

2. Review the changes made by the script to confirm they align with the intended fixes.

### Phase 3: Verification of Fixes

1. Run the verification script again to confirm the fixes have improved calculation consistency:
   ```bash
   python .ruru/sessions/SESSION-BenchmarkCalculationVerification-2505181215/artifacts/notes/benchmark_verification_script.py
   ```

2. Compare the new results against the baseline.

### Phase 4: Run Full Backtesting

1. Run the full backtesting workflow using the improved benchmark implementation:
   ```bash
   python run_improved_backtesting.py
   ```

2. Verify that the benchmark calculations now produce more reasonable results when compared with model performance.

### Phase 5: Documentation Update

1. Update the backtesting documentation to reflect the changes made:
   - Explain the issues that were identified
   - Detail the fixes that were implemented
   - Document the expectation of more consistent benchmark comparison

## Expected Outcomes

After completing this action plan:

1. Benchmark calculations should show more consistent and comparable results to the model
2. The performance gap between model and benchmarks should be more accurately represented
3. The system should maintain a clearer track record of portfolio values throughout the simulation
4. Performance metrics should be calculated in a standardized way across all implementations

## Monitoring

After implementing the fixes, monitor future backtest runs to ensure the issues don't reappear. Consider adding additional validation steps to the benchmark comparison workflow that would alert if inconsistencies are detected.
