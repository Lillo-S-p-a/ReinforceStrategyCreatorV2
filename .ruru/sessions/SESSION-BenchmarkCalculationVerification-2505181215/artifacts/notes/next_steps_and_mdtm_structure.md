# Next Steps & MDTM Task Structure

This document outlines the immediate next steps for implementing the model improvements identified during the benchmark verification process, along with the proposed MDTM (Markdown-Driven Task Management) structure for tracking and managing the implementation tasks.

## 1. Immediate Next Steps

### 1.1. Setup & Organization (Day 1)

1. **Create Implementation Project Directory**
   - Create directory structure: `reinforcestrategycreator/model_improvement/`
   - Set up subdirectories for each implementation phase
   ```
   reinforcestrategycreator/model_improvement/
   â”œâ”€â”€ feature_engineering/
   â”œâ”€â”€ model_architecture/
   â”œâ”€â”€ training/
   â”œâ”€â”€ evaluation/
   â””â”€â”€ deployment/
   ```

2. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - Create a dedicated conda environment for the implementation
   ```bash
   conda create -n model-improvement python=3.9
   conda activate model-improvement
   pip install -r requirements_model_improvement.txt
   ```
   - Create requirements file with necessary dependencies (PyTorch, TA-Lib, etc.)

3. **Initial Configuration & Constants**
   - Create configuration file for model improvement parameters
   ```python
   # reinforcestrategycreator/model_improvement/config.py
   
   # Market regime thresholds
   UPTREND_THRESHOLD = 0.002
   DOWNTREND_THRESHOLD = -0.002
   VOLATILITY_THRESHOLD = 0.01
   TREND_THRESHOLD = 0.001
   HIGH_TREND_THRESHOLD = 0.003
   
   # Reward function scaling factors
   UPTREND_REWARD_SCALE = 1.5
   DOWNTREND_POSITIVE_SCALE = 2.0
   DOWNTREND_NEGATIVE_SCALE = 0.5
   MISSED_UPTREND_PENALTY = 0.05

## 3. Session Structure for Implementation

We will create a new session for implementing each phase of the model improvements. The session structure will be as follows:

### 3.1. Phase Implementation Sessions

Each phase will have its own dedicated session:

```
.ruru/sessions/
â”œâ”€â”€ SESSION-ModelImprovementPhase1-[YYMMDDHHMM]/
â”œâ”€â”€ SESSION-ModelImprovementPhase2-[YYMMDDHHMM]/
â”œâ”€â”€ SESSION-ModelImprovementPhase3-[YYMMDDHHMM]/

   - Target: Improve Sharpe ratio by at least 15% across all market regimes
   - Maintain or improve existing downtrend advantage

3. **Drawdown Protection**
   - Target: Maintain maximum drawdown no worse than current levels
   - Maintain existing strong performance in downtrend scenarios

### 5.2. Regime-Specific Metrics

1. **Uptrend Performance**
   - Target: Achieve at least 75% of benchmark performance in uptrends
   - Reduce missed opportunity rate by 50%

2. **Downtrend Performance**
   - Target: Maintain current 20% advantage over benchmark
   - Further reduce drawdown by 10% if possible

3. **Oscillating Market Performance**
   - Target: Improve current advantage by additional 1%
   - Reduce trading frequency by 15% while maintaining performance

4. **Plateau Market Performance**
   - Target: Convert current -0.07% disadvantage to at least +0.5% advantage
   - Reduce unnecessary trading during low-volatility periods by 25%

### 5.3. Implementation Metrics

1. **Code Quality**
   - Maintain test coverage above 85% for all new components
   - Pass all static code analysis checks (linting, typing)

2. **Performance Efficiency**
   - Ensure feature calculation adds no more than 10% processing time
   - Ensure model inference time remains below 50ms per step

3. **Documentation Quality**
   - Complete API documentation for all components
   - Provide usage examples for all key functions
   - Create visualization guides for all key features

## 6. Next Actions

To begin the implementation process:

1. **Start New Session for Phase 1**
   ```
   New session with goal: "Implementation of Model Improvement Phase 1: Feature Engineering and Data Preparation"
   ```

2. **Create Initial MDTM Task Files**
   ```
   Create task files in .ruru/tasks/MODEL_IMPROVEMENT_PHASE1/ directory
   ```

3. **Assign First Task**
   ```
   Assign TASK-FEATUREENG-20250519-100000.md (Feature Engineering Framework) to dev-python mode
   ```

4. **Begin Implementation**
   ```
   Start with project structure setup and configuration
   ```

By following this structured approach with clear tasks, dependencies, and metrics, we can systematically implement the model improvements identified in our benchmark verification process and achieve significant performance enhancements across all market regimes.
