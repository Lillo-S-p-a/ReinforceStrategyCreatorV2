# Implement Basic Risk Management (Stop-Loss, Take-Profit, Position Sizing)

## 1. Description

As part of Phase 1 of the RL strategy enhancements (based on analysis task `TASK-PYTHON-20250505-203900`), this task focuses on adding basic risk management capabilities to the trading environment (`reinforcestrategycreator/trading_environment.py`).

The current environment lacks explicit stop-loss, take-profit, and position sizing mechanisms, which are critical for managing risk in trading.

Implement the following:
*   **Stop-Loss:** Add logic to automatically close a position if the price moves against it by a configurable percentage or ATR multiple.
*   **Take-Profit:** Add logic to automatically close a position if the price moves favorably by a configurable percentage or ATR multiple.
*   **Basic Position Sizing:** Introduce a simple position sizing mechanism. This could be a fixed fractional approach (e.g., risk X% of capital per trade) or based on volatility (e.g., adjusting size based on ATR). The action space might need adjustment later (Phase 2), but the environment should support calculating and applying a position size other than "all-in".

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

*   The `TradingEnvironment` class in `reinforcestrategycreator/trading_environment.py` is updated to include configurable stop-loss and take-profit parameters (e.g., percentage or ATR-based).
*   The environment's `step` method correctly checks for and triggers stop-loss/take-profit conditions, closing positions accordingly.
*   A basic position sizing calculation is implemented (e.g., fixed fractional) and applied when opening positions. The environment should track available capital and position value correctly.
*   The implementation is configurable (e.g., enabling/disabling SL/TP, setting parameters, choosing sizing method).
*   Relevant unit tests are added or updated in `tests/test_trading_environment.py` (or a new test file) to verify the stop-loss, take-profit, and position sizing logic.
*   Code is committed to the `feature/rl-strategy-enhancements` branch.

## 3. Checklist

*   [✅] Define configuration parameters for SL, TP, and position sizing method/parameters in `TradingEnvironment.__init__`.
*   [✅] Implement logic within the `step` method to check SL conditions for open positions.
*   [✅] Implement logic within the `step` method to check TP conditions for open positions.
*   [✅] Implement the chosen basic position sizing calculation logic (e.g., fixed fractional).
*   [✅] Modify the position opening logic (`_take_action`) to use the calculated position size instead of always going all-in.
*   [✅] Ensure portfolio value, cash, and position tracking are updated correctly considering partial position sizes.
*   [✅] Write/update unit tests for SL triggering.
*   [✅] Write/update unit tests for TP triggering.
*   [✅] Write/update unit tests for position sizing calculation and application.
*   [ ] Test the changes within the existing training loop (`train.py`) to ensure compatibility.
*   [ ] Commit changes to the `feature/rl-strategy-enhancements` branch following commit standards (Rule `07`).

## 4. Logs / Notes

*   (2025-05-05) Implemented percentage-based SL/TP checks in `step` method.
*   (2025-05-05) Implemented fixed fractional position sizing in `_execute_trade_action`.
*   (2025-05-05) Added unit tests for SL, TP, and position sizing logic in `tests/test_trading_environment.py`. All tests passed.
