# Create Implementation Plan for Model Pipeline Refactoring

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

*   **What is this feature?**
    This task is to create a detailed implementation plan for refactoring the `test_model_selection_improvements.py` script into the production-grade modular model pipeline, based on the approved architecture defined in [`.ruru/docs/architecture/model_pipeline_v1_architecture.md`](.ruru/docs/architecture/model_pipeline_v1_architecture.md).
*   **Why is it needed?**
    A comprehensive architecture design exists. Now, a clear, actionable plan is required to guide the development effort, break down the work into manageable tasks, identify dependencies, and assign responsibilities.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Review the architecture document: [`.ruru/docs/architecture/model_pipeline_v1_architecture.md`](.ruru/docs/architecture/model_pipeline_v1_architecture.md).
    *   Break down the overall refactoring and implementation effort into logical epics, features, or user stories.
    *   For each identified work package, define:
        *   A clear objective.
        *   Key inputs and expected outputs/deliverables.
        *   Estimated effort (e.g., T-shirt size, story points, or rough time).
        *   Dependencies on other work packages.
        *   Suggested specialist mode(s) for implementation (e.g., `dev-python`, `infra-specialist`).
    *   Define a logical sequence or phases for the implementation.
    *   Identify any prerequisites or setup tasks required before development can begin.
    *   The output should be a new planning document (e.g., in `.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md`).
*   **Links:**
    *   Architecture Document: [`.ruru/docs/architecture/model_pipeline_v1_architecture.md`](.ruru/docs/architecture/model_pipeline_v1_architecture.md)
    *   Original Script: [`test_model_selection_improvements.py`](test_model_selection_improvements.py)
    *   Session Log: [`.ruru/sessions/SESSION-AnalyzeDocTestModelSelectionPy-2505281202/session_log.md`](.ruru/sessions/SESSION-AnalyzeDocTestModelSelectionPy-2505281202/session_log.md)

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [‚úÖ] An implementation plan document is produced and stored in `.ruru/planning/`.
*   - [‚úÖ] The plan clearly breaks down the architecture into a series of development tasks/epics.
*   - [‚úÖ] Each task in the plan has a defined objective, deliverables, and estimated effort.
*   - [‚úÖ] Dependencies between tasks are clearly identified.
*   - [‚úÖ] A logical sequence or phasing for the implementation is proposed.
*   - [‚úÖ] Appropriate specialist modes are suggested for each development task.
*   - [‚úÖ] The plan addresses all major components outlined in the architecture document.

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks üìù

*   - [‚úÖ] Thoroughly review the architecture document.
*   - [‚úÖ] Identify the main modules/components from the architecture that need to be built or refactored.
*   - [‚úÖ] For each module, list the specific functionalities to be implemented.
*   - [‚úÖ] Group functionalities into logical development tasks.
*   - [‚úÖ] Consider the order of implementation based on dependencies (e.g., core data structures first, then processing logic, then API layers).
*   - [‚úÖ] Create a visual representation if helpful (e.g., a simple Gantt chart idea or dependency graph).
