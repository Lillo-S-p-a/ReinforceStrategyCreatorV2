# Design Production-Grade Modular Model Pipeline Architecture

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

*   **What is this feature?**
    This task is to design a robust, modular, and production-grade architecture for our model pipeline. The current `test_model_selection_improvements.py` script (and its HPO capabilities) serves as the conceptual core for model selection and should be refactored and expanded into this new pipeline.
*   **Why is it needed?**
    The existing script is a test harness. To move towards production and paper trading, we need a well-structured pipeline that is maintainable, scalable, configurable, and allows for clear separation of concerns (data processing, feature engineering, model training, HPO, evaluation, deployment, monitoring).
*   **Scope:**
    *   Define the overall architecture of the model pipeline.
    *   Propose a modular structure (e.g., Python packages, modules, classes).
    *   Identify key components and their responsibilities (e.g., data ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, HPO, evaluation, model registry, artifact storage, deployment hooks, monitoring integration).
    *   Outline how configuration management will be handled (e.g., for different models, datasets, HPO settings).
    *   Consider how artifacts (models, metrics, logs, reports) will be managed and versioned.
    *   Address how the HPO process will be integrated as a core part of model selection.
    *   Consider future needs like paper trading integration and live deployment.
    *   The output should be a detailed architecture design document (e.g., a new Markdown file in `.ruru/docs/architecture/` or `.ruru/planning/`).
*   **Links:**
    *   Existing script: [`test_model_selection_improvements.py`](test_model_selection_improvements.py)
    *   Documentation for existing script: [`docs/test_model_selection_improvements_script_documentation.md`](docs/test_model_selection_improvements_script_documentation.md)
    *   Session Log for context: [`.ruru/sessions/SESSION-AnalyzeDocTestModelSelectionPy-2505281202/session_log.md`](.ruru/sessions/SESSION-AnalyzeDocTestModelSelectionPy-2505281202/session_log.md)

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [‚úÖ] A detailed architecture design document is produced.
*   - [‚úÖ] The proposed architecture is modular and promotes separation of concerns.
*   - [‚úÖ] The design clearly outlines how the functionality of `test_model_selection_improvements.py` (especially HPO) will be integrated and enhanced.
*   - [‚úÖ] Key components of the pipeline are identified with their responsibilities.
*   - [‚úÖ] Configuration management strategy is defined.
*   - [‚úÖ] Artifact management (models, metrics, logs) strategy is outlined.
*   - [‚úÖ] The design considers future production deployment and paper trading needs.
*   - [‚úÖ] The design specifies how different parts of the pipeline will interact (e.g., data flow, control flow).
*   - [‚úÖ] Potential technologies or libraries for key components can be suggested (optional but helpful).
*   - [‚úÖ] The design document is stored in an appropriate location (e.g., `.ruru/docs/architecture/model_pipeline_v1_architecture.md`).

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks üìù

*   - [‚úÖ] Review `test_model_selection_improvements.py` and its documentation.
*   - [‚úÖ] Identify core functionalities to be preserved and refactored.
*   - [‚úÖ] Define distinct stages of the pipeline (e.g., Data Ingestion, Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Model Training & HPO, Evaluation, Deployment).
*   - [‚úÖ] For each stage, define inputs, outputs, and primary responsibilities.
*   - [‚úÖ] Propose a directory structure and module organization.
*   - [‚úÖ] Design a flexible configuration system (e.g., using YAML or JSON files, potentially managed via a central config service or library).
*   - [‚úÖ] Consider logging, monitoring, and alerting aspects for a production environment.
*   - [‚úÖ] Think about how to manage different model types and their specific HPO requirements.
