# Task: Improve Frontend Presentation for Detailed Decision Analysis Metrics

## 1. Description

The user wants to improve the frontend presentation of the "Detailed Decision Analysis" section in the Streamlit dashboard (see user-provided image). This involves enhancing clarity, potentially adding visualizations, and ensuring the information is easily understandable. This task depends on the output and definitions provided by the backend task (`TASK-BACKEND-20250505-211848`).

**Current Display:**
*   Shows metrics as text lines (e.g., "Metric Name: Value - Description").
*   Splits "Best Decision Context" and "Worst Decision Context" into two columns with bullet points.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

*   Review the current Streamlit code responsible for displaying this section (likely in `dashboard/visualization.py` or `dashboard/main.py`).
*   Improve the layout and presentation for better readability and visual appeal. Consider using Streamlit columns, expanders, or cards.
*   Clearly explain what "Typical Action: 0.0" and "Typical Action: 1.0" mean (coordinate with backend task for definitions). Add tooltips or descriptive labels.
*   Consider adding simple visualizations if appropriate (e.g., small bar charts for context comparison, better highlighting for correlation).
*   Ensure consistent formatting for percentages, decimals, etc.
*   Adapt the frontend to display any new or modified metrics provided by the backend task.
*   Ensure the display is responsive and looks good on typical screen sizes.

## 3. Checklist

*   [âœ…] Locate the Streamlit code rendering the "Detailed Decision Analysis" section (`dashboard/main.py`, lines ~197-239).
*   [âœ…] Coordinate with the backend task (`TASK-BACKEND-20250505-211848`) and coordination task (`TASK-COORD-20250505-213800`) to get updated metric definitions (note potential name changes like `buy_on_asset_price_up_rate`) and new metrics. (Coordination complete via TASK-COORD)
*   [âœ…] Confirm "Typical Action" definitions: `0`='flat', `1`='long', `2`='short'. Note: The API now returns the string representation ('flat', 'long', 'short') directly in the `typical_action` field. (Confirmed via TASK-COORD)
*   [âœ…] **Implement UI Enhancements in `dashboard/main.py` (lines ~197-239):** (Completed by dev-python)
    *   [âœ…] **General Metrics Section (lines ~201-216):**
        *   [âœ…] Replace `st.write` with `st.metric` for: `action_change_rate`, `buy_on_asset_price_up_rate` (use this new key), `sell_on_price_down_rate`, `buy_in_uptrend_rate`, `sell_in_downtrend_rate`. Format value as percentage (e.g., `f"{value:.1f}%"`), add descriptive `help` text.
        *   [âœ…] Use `st.metric` for `action_future_return_correlation`. Format to 3 decimals, add `help` text.
        *   [âœ…] Add `st.metric` for new metric `reward_volatility`. Format appropriately (e.g., 4 decimals), add `help` text.
        *   [âœ…] Add `st.metric` for new metric `avg_consecutive_action_duration`. Format (e.g., `f"{value:.1f} steps"`), add `help` text.
    *   [âœ…] **Per-Action Metrics Section (New):**
        *   [âœ…] Add a subheader like `st.subheader("Metrics per Action")`.
        *   [âœ…] Display `avg_consecutive_duration_per_action` (dict). Use `st.columns` to show 'flat', 'long', 'short' durations side-by-side, possibly with `st.metric`. Add `help` text.
        *   [âœ…] Display `avg_reward_per_action` (dict). Use `st.columns` similar to above, possibly with `st.metric`. Add `help` text.
    *   [âœ…] **Decision Contexts Section (lines ~218-237):**
        *   [âœ…] Keep the `st.columns(2)` layout for Best/Worst.
        *   [âœ…] Inside each column, replace `st.write` with `st.metric` for `Avg Price` (format `:.2f`), `Avg Price Change` (format `:.2f%`), `Avg Reward` (format `:.4f`). Add `help` text.
        *   [âœ…] Display `Typical Action` using `st.write` or similar, clearly showing the string ('flat', 'long', 'short'). Add `help` text explaining the terms (e.g., `help="Most common action: flat=hold, long=buy, short=sell"`).
        *   [âœ…] (Optional) Consider using `delta` in `st.metric` for `Avg Reward` to show the difference between Best and Worst contexts.
    *   [âœ…] **General:**
        *   [âœ…] Ensure all metrics use `.get('metric_key', default_value)` for safety.
        *   [âœ…] Review and ensure consistent number formatting throughout the section.
*   [âœ…] Test the updated UI with sample data from the API. (Completed by dev-python)
*   [âœ…] Verify responsiveness (Streamlit handles much of this, but check layout). (Completed by dev-python)

## 4. Implementation Notes & Logs

*(Specialist will add notes here during execution)*

*   **2025-05-05 (lead-frontend):** Updated checklist based on coordination task `TASK-COORD-20250505-213800` detailing backend metric changes (new metrics, name changes, action code definitions). Found relevant code in `dashboard/main.py`. Prepared detailed implementation steps for specialist. Delegated to `dev-python`.
*   **2025-05-05 (dev-python):** Implemented UI enhancements in `dashboard/main.py` as per checklist. Used `st.metric`, columns, and help text. Added new metrics and per-action section. Verified formatting and safety checks. Tested with sample data.
*   **2025-05-05 (lead-frontend):** Received confirmation from `dev-python`. Marking task as Done.
