# Fix SyntaxError in episodes.py Router

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

*   **What is the problem?** A `SyntaxError` exists in `reinforcestrategycreator/api/routers/episodes.py`, introduced during the implementation of the trading operations endpoint (Task `TASK-BE-LEAD-20250505-122100`).
*   **Where does it occur?** The error occurs around line 27 (or potentially line 20 based on traceback variations) in `reinforcestrategycreator/api/routers/episodes.py`. The specific error is `SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Perhaps you forgot a comma?` related to the `DEFAULT_OPERATIONS_PAGE_SIZE` constant definition.
*   **Impact:** The Uvicorn API servers fail to reload/start due to the syntax error, making the API unusable and blocking frontend development that depends on the new endpoint.

## Steps to Reproduce üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

1.  Observe the Uvicorn server logs after the changes from task `TASK-BE-LEAD-20250505-122100` were applied.
2.  Note the `SyntaxError` traceback pointing to `reinforcestrategycreator/api/routers/episodes.py`.

## Expected Behavior ‚úÖ

*   The Uvicorn servers should start and reload successfully without any `SyntaxError`.
*   The API should be functional.

## Actual Behavior ‚ùå

*   The Uvicorn servers crash during startup/reload, logging a `SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Perhaps you forgot a comma?` originating from `reinforcestrategycreator/api/routers/episodes.py`.

## Environment Details üñ•Ô∏è (Optional - Use if not in TOML)

*   See Uvicorn logs provided in the main chat context.

## Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done) ‚úÖ

*   - [ ] The `SyntaxError` in `reinforcestrategycreator/api/routers/episodes.py` is corrected.
*   - [ ] Both Uvicorn servers (ports 8000 and 8001) start and reload successfully without errors.
*   - [ ] The previously implemented endpoint `GET /api/v1/episodes/{episode_id}/operations/` is confirmed to be syntactically correct and loadable by FastAPI.

## Implementation Notes / Root Cause Analysis üìù

*   Likely a typo or missing comma near the definition of `DEFAULT_OPERATIONS_PAGE_SIZE` in `episodes.py`. Review the code around line 20-27 carefully.

## AI Prompt Log ü§ñ (Optional)

*   (Log key prompts and AI responses)

## Review Notes üëÄ (For Reviewer)

*   Verify the syntax fix.
*   Confirm servers restart correctly.
