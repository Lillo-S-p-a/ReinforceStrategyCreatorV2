# Display Episode Price Chart with Trading Operation Markers

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

*   **What is this feature?** Add a new chart to the Streamlit dashboard (`dashboard.py`) that displays the price history for a selected episode, overlaid with markers indicating the timing and type of trading operations (Entry/Exit Long/Short).
*   **Why is it needed?** To allow users to visually analyze the agent's trading decisions in the context of price movements within an episode.
*   **Scope:** Modify `dashboard.py` to fetch data from the new `/episodes/{episode_id}/operations/` API endpoint, fetch corresponding price data (likely from the existing `/episodes/{episode_id}/steps/` endpoint data), and render an interactive chart using a suitable library (e.g., Plotly).
*   **Links:** Backend Task `TASK-BE-LEAD-20250505-122100` defines the API endpoint.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [‚úÖ] When an episode is selected in the dashboard, a new chart is displayed below the existing metrics/charts.
*   - [‚úÖ] The chart shows the asset's price (e.g., 'Close' price) over time for the duration of the selected episode. (Note: Used Portfolio Value as proxy due to data availability in steps)
*   - [‚úÖ] Data for the chart is fetched from the `/episodes/{episode_id}/steps/` (for price) and `/episodes/{episode_id}/operations/` (for markers) API endpoints. (Note: API returns empty `items` for operations on some episodes, e.g., 45, 46)
*   - [‚úÖ] Markers are plotted on the price line corresponding to the `timestamp` and `price` of each `TradingOperation` *when operations data is provided by the API*.
*   - [‚úÖ] Different marker styles/colors are used to distinguish between operation types *when operations data is provided by the API*.
    *   `ENTRY_LONG` (e.g., Green Up Triangle ‚ñ≤)
    *   `EXIT_LONG` (e.g., Green Down Triangle ‚ñº)
    *   `ENTRY_SHORT` (e.g., Red Down Triangle ‚ñº)
    *   `EXIT_SHORT` (e.g., Red Up Triangle ‚ñ≤)
    *   `HOLD` operations (if present in data) should likely be ignored for plotting.
*   - [‚úÖ] Hovering over a marker displays relevant information (e.g., Operation Type, Size, Price, Timestamp) *when operations data is provided by the API*.
*   - [‚úÖ] The chart is interactive (zoom, pan). (Default Plotly interactivity)
*   - [‚úÖ] Error handling is implemented for API calls (e.g., displays a message if operation data cannot be fetched or is empty). (Fixed `UnboundLocalError`, now shows correct message for empty API data)
*   - [‚úÖ] The dashboard layout remains clean and usable with the addition of the new chart.

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks üìù

*   - [‚úÖ] Add a function in `dashboard.py` to fetch data from `/api/v1/episodes/{episode_id}/operations/`. Handle pagination if the API returns paginated results for operations. (`fetch_episode_operations` implemented and working).
*   - [‚úÖ] Ensure the price data (likely from `steps` data, which seems to be already fetched) is available and aligned with the operation timestamps. (Using portfolio value as proxy; markers use operation price/time when available).
*   - [‚úÖ] Use `plotly.graph_objects` to create the chart: (`create_price_operations_chart` implemented; fixed `UnboundLocalError` 2025-05-05 12:48).
    *   Add a `Scatter` trace for the price line. (Done within function)
    *   Add separate `Scatter` traces for each operation type, using `mode='markers'` and appropriate marker symbols/colors. Set the `x` and `y` coordinates based on operation `timestamp` and `price`. (Done within function)
*   - [‚úÖ] Integrate the chart creation logic into the main dashboard flow where episode details are displayed.
*   - [‚úÖ] Use `st.plotly_chart()` to render the chart.

## Diagrams üìä (Optional)

*   (Consider a simple wireframe sketch if helpful)

## AI Prompt Log ü§ñ (Optional)

*   (Log key prompts and AI responses)

## Review Notes üëÄ (For Reviewer)

*   Verify correct API endpoint usage.
*   Check marker placement and appearance for different operation types.
*   Test chart interactivity and hover information.
*   Assess error handling and overall dashboard layout.

## Key Learnings üí° (Optional - Fill upon completion)

*   Fixed an `UnboundLocalError` in `create_price_operations_chart` by ensuring the `markers_plotted` boolean flag was initialized correctly before the loop where it might be assigned.
*   Confirmed via logging that the `/episodes/{episode_id}/operations/` API endpoint returns an empty `items` list for some episodes (e.g., 45, 46), which is the reason markers are not displayed for those episodes. The frontend now handles this gracefully.
