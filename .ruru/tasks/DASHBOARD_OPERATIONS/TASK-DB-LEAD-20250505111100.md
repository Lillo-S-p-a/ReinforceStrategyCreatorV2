# Description

The dashboard needs to display detailed trading operations (entry long, exit long, entry short, exit short) for each episode. This requires storing these specific events in the database.

# Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new database table (e.g., `TradingOperation`) is designed and implemented (`db_models.py`).
2.  The table should store at least:
    *   `operation_id` (Primary Key)
    *   `step_id` (Foreign Key to `Step`)
    *   `episode_id` (Foreign Key to `Episode`, for easier querying)
    *   `timestamp` (from the corresponding step)
    *   `operation_type` (Enum/String: e.g., 'ENTRY_LONG', 'EXIT_LONG', 'ENTRY_SHORT', 'EXIT_SHORT')
    *   `size` (Amount traded)
    *   `price` (Execution price at that step)
    *   Potentially other relevant details like PnL for the specific trade upon exit.
3.  The `TradingEnvironment` (`trading_environment.py`) or related logic is modified to identify when these specific operations occur based on actions and position changes.
4.  The identified operations are saved to the new database table via `db_utils.py` during the simulation run.
5.  Database migrations (if applicable using Alembic or similar) are created or instructions for manual schema updates are provided.

# Checklist

- [ ] Design the `TradingOperation` table schema.
- [ ] Update `reinforcestrategycreator/db_models.py` with the new model.
- [ ] Determine the logic in `reinforcestrategycreator/trading_environment.py` (or elsewhere) to detect entry/exit operations.
- [ ] Implement the detection logic.
- [ ] Update `reinforcestrategycreator/db_utils.py` with functions to save `TradingOperation` instances.
- [ ] Integrate the saving logic into the training/simulation loop where steps are processed.
- [ ] Create database migration scripts or provide manual SQL commands.
- [ ] Add basic tests for the operation detection and saving logic (optional but recommended).

# Notes

*   Consider how to handle partial exits or scaling in/out if the strategy allows it. The `operation_type` might need to be more granular, or additional fields might be required.
*   Ensure foreign key relationships are correctly defined for `step_id` and `episode_id`.
*   This task provides the data foundation. Subsequent tasks will create API endpoints and update the frontend.
