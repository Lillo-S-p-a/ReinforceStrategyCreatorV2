# Description

Implement the new `TradingOperation` SQLAlchemy model in `reinforcestrategycreator/db_models.py` as defined by the Database Lead. This model will store details about individual trading actions (entry/exit long/short).

# Acceptance Criteria

1.  The `TradingOperation` class is added to `reinforcestrategycreator/db_models.py`.
2.  The class inherits from the project's SQLAlchemy `Base`.
3.  All specified columns (`operation_id`, `step_id`, `episode_id`, `timestamp`, `operation_type`, `size`, `price`) are correctly defined with appropriate types, constraints (ForeignKey, nullable), and indices.
4.  An `OperationType` enum (using `enum.Enum`) is defined and used for the `operation_type` column.
5.  Basic relationships (`step`, `episode`) are defined using `relationship()`. Ensure `back_populates` arguments are added (you may need to add the corresponding `operations` relationship to the `Step` and `Episode` models if they don't exist).
6.  Necessary imports (`enum`, SQLAlchemy components) are added.
7.  The code adheres to project coding standards (linting, formatting).

# Checklist

- [âœ…] Define `OperationType` enum.
- [âœ…] Define `TradingOperation` class inheriting from `Base`.
- [âœ…] Add all required columns with correct types and constraints.
- [âœ…] Add `step` and `episode` relationships.
- [âœ…] Add `operations` relationship with `back_populates` to `Step` model (if needed).
- [âœ…] Add `operations` relationship with `back_populates` to `Episode` model (if needed).
- [âœ…] Add necessary imports.
- [âœ…] Ensure code is linted and formatted correctly.

# Notes

*   Refer to the parent task `.ruru/tasks/DASHBOARD_OPERATIONS/TASK-DB-LEAD-20250505111100.md` for the schema design details provided by the DB Lead.
*   Pay attention to the existing `Base` class and foreign key targets (`steps.step_id`, `episodes.episode_id`). Verify these table/column names match the existing schema.
*   Modifying `Step` and `Episode` models to add `back_populates` is within the scope of this task if required for the relationship definition.
