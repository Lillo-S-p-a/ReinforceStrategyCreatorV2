# Create API Endpoint for Trading Operations per Episode

## Description ✍️

*   **What is this feature?** A new FastAPI API endpoint to retrieve all trading operations recorded for a specific training episode.
*   **Why is it needed?** To provide the necessary data for the frontend dashboard to visualize trading entry/exit points on a price chart for a selected episode.
*   **Scope:** Create the GET endpoint, associated Pydantic schema, database query logic, and integrate it into the existing API structure.
*   **Links:** `reinforcestrategycreator/db_models.py` (defines `TradingOperation`)

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

*   - [✅] Endpoint `GET /api/v1/episodes/{episode_id}/operations/` is created and functional.
*   - [✅] Endpoint returns a paginated list of `TradingOperation` objects for the specified `episode_id`.
*   - [✅] A Pydantic schema (e.g., `TradingOperationRead`) is created in `reinforcestrategycreator/api/schemas/` for the response model.
*   - [✅] The schema includes all relevant fields from the `TradingOperation` model (`operation_id`, `step_id`, `timestamp`, `operation_type`, `size`, `price`).
*   - [✅] Endpoint handles `episode_id` not found errors gracefully (e.g., HTTP 404).
*   - [✅] Pagination query parameters (`page`, `page_size`) are implemented and functional.
*   - [✅] The endpoint is added to the appropriate FastAPI router (likely `reinforcestrategycreator/api/routers/episodes.py`).
*   - [✅] Database query efficiently retrieves operations for the given episode, ordered by timestamp.
*   - [✅] Endpoint is protected by the existing API key dependency (`api_key: APIKey = Depends(get_api_key)`).
*   - [✅] Basic API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI) is automatically generated for the new endpoint.

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks 📝

*   - [✅] Create `TradingOperationRead` schema in a relevant file (e.g., `reinforcestrategycreator/api/schemas/operations.py` or add to `metrics.py` if small). Ensure `operation_type` uses the `OperationType` enum. (Delegated: TASK-FASTAPI-DEV-20250505-122200-Schema)
*   - [✅] Add the new route function (e.g., `read_episode_operations`) to `reinforcestrategycreator/api/routers/episodes.py`. (Delegated: TASK-FASTAPI-DEV-20250505-122400-Endpoint)
*   - [✅] Implement the database query logic within the route function using the injected SQLAlchemy session. Use `offset()` and `limit()` for pagination. (Delegated: TASK-FASTAPI-DEV-20250505-122400-Endpoint)
*   - [✅] Add appropriate response model (`response_model=List[TradingOperationRead]`) and status codes to the route decorator. (Delegated: TASK-FASTAPI-DEV-20250505-122400-Endpoint)
*   - [✅] Consider adding an index to `trading_operations` table on `(episode_id, timestamp)` if performance becomes an issue (DB Lead to advise if needed, basic indices already added in previous task). (Index exists from TASK-DB-LEAD-20250504000430)
