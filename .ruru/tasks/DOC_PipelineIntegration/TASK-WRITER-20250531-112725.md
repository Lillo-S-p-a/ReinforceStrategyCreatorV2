# Integrate Mermaid Diagrams into ReinforceStrategyCreator Pipeline Documentation

## Description ✍️

*   **What needs to be done?** The previously created Mermaid diagrams need to be integrated into the main pipeline documentation file: `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline_v1.md`.
*   **Why is it needed?** To complete the documentation by embedding the visual aids into the relevant sections of the text.
*   **Target Audience (for context):** Data Scientists, Quant Analysts, ML Engineers.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Identify the placeholder sections in `.ruru/docs/pipeline/reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline_v1.md` where Mermaid diagrams are to be inserted.
    *   Locate the corresponding Mermaid diagram code from the files in `.ruru/docs/pipeline/diagrams/` (refer to `TASK-DIAG-20250531-013400.md` for the list of created diagrams and their intended purpose if needed).
    *   Replace the placeholders in the main documentation file with the actual Mermaid code blocks.
    *   Ensure the Mermaid code is correctly formatted within the main document for proper rendering.

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

*   - [ ] All diagram placeholders in `.ruru/docs/pipeline/reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline_v1.md` are replaced with the correct Mermaid code blocks.
*   - [ ] The Mermaid code for each diagram is accurately transcribed from the individual diagram files located in `.ruru/docs/pipeline/diagrams/`.
*   - [ ] The main documentation file `.ruru/docs/pipeline/reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline_v1.md` is updated with the embedded diagrams.
*   - [ ] The formatting of the embedded Mermaid code blocks is correct (e.g., within ```mermaid ... ``` tags).
*   - [ ] The final integrated document is saved.

## Implementation Notes / Content Outline 📝

*   The main documentation file to be modified is: `.ruru/docs/pipeline/reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline_v1.md`.
*   The individual Mermaid diagram files are located in: `.ruru/docs/pipeline/diagrams/`.
*   The `util-writer` task `TASK-WRITER-20250531-013325` (which created the main doc) and `design-diagramer` task `TASK-DIAG-20250531-013400` (which created the diagrams) provide context on placeholders and diagram content.
*   Carefully match each placeholder with its corresponding diagram.
