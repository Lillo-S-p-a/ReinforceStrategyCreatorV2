## Description

The [`test_model_selection_improvements.py`](test_model_selection_improvements.py) script produces warnings when sending certain model configuration parameters to Datadog. This is because their values are non-numeric (strings or lists) but are being sent as numerical metrics (gauges).

**Warnings:**
```
WARNING - Failed to send Datadog metric model.config.type: could not convert string to float: 'dqn'
WARNING - Failed to send Datadog metric model.config.layers: float() argument must be a string or a real number, not 'list'
```

These warnings occur because the `_send_metric` function (or the underlying `statsd.gauge` call) expects a float value for the metric.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  The script [`test_model_selection_improvements.py`](test_model_selection_improvements.py) runs without the aforementioned Datadog metric sending warnings related to `model.config.type` and `model.config.layers`.
2.  The information from `model.config.type` (e.g., 'dqn') and `model.config.layers` (e.g., `[256, 128]`) is still conveyed to Datadog, but as tags associated with relevant metrics, rather than as standalone numerical metrics.

## Checklist

- [‚úÖ] **Analyze `_send_initial_global_metrics` in `ModelSelectionTester`:** (No direct `model_config` iteration found here, handled in approach-specific methods)
    - [‚úÖ] Identify where `self.config.get('model_config', {})` parameters are processed and sent to Datadog. (Done, primarily in `run_original_approach`, `run_enhanced_approach`, `run_hpo_approach`)
    - [‚úÖ] Modify the logic for handling `model_config` items: (Done via `_process_model_config_for_datadog` helper)
        - [‚úÖ] If a `key` like `'model_type'` has a string `value` (e.g., 'dqn'), convert this into a tag (e.g., `model_type:dqn`). This tag should be added to the `current_tags` list used for other metrics sent within this method's scope. Do not attempt to send this key-value pair as a numerical metric.
        - [‚úÖ] If a `key` like `'layers'` has a list `value` (e.g., `[256, 128]`), convert this into descriptive tags (e.g., `num_layers:2`, `layer_0_size:256`, `layer_1_size:128`). These tags should also be added to `current_tags`. Do not attempt to send this key-value pair as a numerical metric.
        - [‚úÖ] Ensure that other, genuinely numeric `model_config` parameters continue to be sent as gauge metrics.
- [‚úÖ] **Analyze `_run_cv_fold` (and similar methods like `_run_single_config_iteration` if HPO is involved, or `run_approach_config` which processes `model_config_to_use`):** (Analysis showed these are covered by changes in `run_original_approach`, `run_enhanced_approach`, `run_hpo_approach`)
    - [‚úÖ] These methods likely process `model_config_to_use` (which might be derived from `trial.config` during HPO or `self.config.get('model_config')` otherwise).
    - [‚úÖ] Identify the loop or section where items from `model_config_to_use` are iterated through and sent as metrics. (Done)
    - [‚úÖ] Apply similar logic as in `_send_initial_global_metrics`: (Done via `_process_model_config_for_datadog` helper)
        - [‚úÖ] For string values (e.g., `model_config_to_use['model_type']`), create a corresponding tag (e.g., `model_type:<value>`) and add it to the `common_tags_for_iteration` (or an equivalent tag list for that specific scope).
        - [‚úÖ] For list values (e.g., `model_config_to_use['layers']`), create corresponding tags (e.g., `num_layers:<count>`, `layer_<i>_size:<size>`) and add them to `common_tags_for_iteration`.
        - [‚úÖ] Prevent these non-numeric values from being passed directly to `self._send_metric` as the main `value` argument if they are not suitable for numerical metrics.
- [‚úÖ] **Consider Generalizing Tag Creation for Model Config:**
    - [‚úÖ] Evaluate if a helper function within `ModelSelectionTester`, such as `_get_tags_from_model_config(self, model_config)`, would be beneficial. This function would take a `model_config` dictionary and return a list of string tags derived from its non-numeric or complex values (like `model_type`, `layers`). (Implemented as `_process_model_config_for_datadog`)
    - [‚úÖ] This generated list of tags could then be appended to the `tags` argument of `_send_metric` calls when reporting other relevant metrics (e.g., performance metrics for a model characterized by this configuration). (Implemented)
    - [‚úÖ] Numeric `model_config` values (e.g., `learning_rate`, `batch_size`, boolean flags represented as 0/1) should continue to be sent as gauge metrics as they currently are. (Implemented)
- [‚úÖ] **Analyze `run_ablation_study` and its called methods (e.g., `run_approach_config` for ablation):**
- [‚úÖ] Ensure that the `_process_model_config_for_datadog` helper method (or equivalent logic) is consistently used for all model configurations processed during the ablation study.
- [‚úÖ] Specifically, check how `model_config_to_use` is handled within the loop that iterates through `self.ablation_configurations`.
- [‚úÖ] The goal is to ensure non-numeric config values from ablation configurations are also converted to tags.
- [‚úÖ] **Verification:**
    - [‚úÖ] After implementing the changes, the script should be runnable.
    - [‚úÖ] Confirm that the specific warnings related to `model.config.type` and `model.config.layers` no longer appear in the script's output **across all execution paths, including the ablation study**.
    - [ ] (User/Manual) Verify in the Datadog UI that the information previously causing warnings (e.g., model type 'dqn', layer architecture) now appears as tags associated with relevant metrics from all approaches.
