# Create Comprehensive Documentation for Improved Backtesting System

## Description

Create detailed technical documentation explaining how the improved backtesting system works in the ReinforceStrategyCreator project. The documentation should cover the entire workflow from data preparation to model deployment in production.

The document should be created in the `docs` directory as `docs/improved_backtesting_system.md` and should include Mermaid diagrams where appropriate to improve clarity and understanding.

## Requirements

The documentation must include the following sections:

### 1. Overview of the Backtesting System
- High-level explanation of what the system does
- Main components and their interactions
- Flow diagram using Mermaid

### 2. Backtesting Period and Data
- Explain which time period is used for backtesting (2018-01-01 to 2023-01-01)
- How the data is split between training and testing
- What data sources are used
- What preprocessing is applied

### 3. Model Architecture and Training
- Detailed explanation of the reinforcement learning model
- Parameters used for training
- Feature engineering and inputs
- Policies implemented
- Reward function design
- Weights initialization and update methods
- Hyperparameter configuration

### 4. Training Process
- How cross-validation is performed
- Number of episodes and iterations
- How the training progress is monitored
- Stopping criteria

### 5. Benchmarking and Model Selection
- How different runs are compared
- Benchmarking strategies (Buy and Hold, SMA, Random)
- Performance metrics used (PnL, Sharpe, Drawdown, Win Rate)
- Criteria for selecting the final model

### 6. Results Visualization and Reporting
- What visualizations are generated
- How to interpret the HTML reports
- Where results are stored

### 7. Production Deployment Guide
- How to take a trained model and deploy it for paper trading
- Step-by-step instructions for setting up paper trading
- Configuration required for production use
- Monitoring and evaluation in production

## Technical Notes

- Use Mermaid diagrams for:
  1. Overall system architecture
  2. Training workflow
  3. Model selection process
  4. Deployment pipeline

- Examine the following files for implementation details:
  - `reinforcestrategycreator/backtesting/workflow.py`: Overall workflow
  - `reinforcestrategycreator/backtesting/model.py`: Model training
  - `reinforcestrategycreator/backtesting/data.py`: Data preparation
  - `reinforcestrategycreator/backtesting/evaluation.py`: Metrics calculation
  - `reinforcestrategycreator/backtesting/benchmarks.py`: Benchmark strategies
  - `reinforcestrategycreator/backtesting/export.py`: Production export
  - `reinforcestrategycreator/trading_environment.py`: Trading environment
  - `reinforcestrategycreator/rl_agent.py`: RL agent implementation
  - `run_improved_backtesting.py`: Main entry point

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Comprehensive document covering all required sections
- [x] Clear, well-formatted Markdown with proper headings
- [x] Mermaid diagrams included for key processes
- [x] Technical accuracy verified against codebase
- [x] Complete deployment guide for paper trading
- [x] Document saved at docs/improved_backtesting_system.md

## Checklist

- [ ] Review codebase to understand implementation details
- [ ] Create outline for documentation
- [ ] Draft overview and system architecture sections
- [ ] Create Mermaid diagrams for key workflows
- [ ] Document backtesting period and data preprocessing
- [ ] Document model architecture and training process
- [ ] Document benchmarking and model selection
- [ ] Document results visualization and reporting
- [ ] Create detailed production deployment guide
- [ ] Review and finalize document
- [ ] Save completed document to docs/improved_backtesting_system.md

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to explain concepts in a clear way that someone with basic ML knowledge can understand
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Link to relevant external resources for further learning
- Consider adding a glossary section for technical terms
