# Task: Integrate Components for Training Pipeline

## 1. Description üìù

Create the main entry point script (`train.py`) that connects all the developed components (Data Fetcher, Technical Analyzer, Trading Environment, RL Agent) to form a runnable reinforcement learning training pipeline. This corresponds to Phase 5 of the initial plan.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   [ ] Create a new Python script `train.py` in the project root (`/home/alessio/Development/ReinforceStrategyCreator/train.py`).
*   [ ] Import necessary classes/functions from the `reinforcestrategycreator` package.
*   [ ] Define configuration parameters at the top of the script (or load from a config file - simpler for now to define directly):
    *   `TICKER = "SPY"`
    *   `START_DATE = "2020-01-01"`
    *   `END_DATE = "2023-12-31"`
    *   `TRAINING_EPISODES = 100` # Or a smaller number for initial testing (e.g., 10)
    *   Agent hyperparameters (learning rate, gamma, epsilon settings, batch size, memory size, target update freq) - use defaults from `StrategyAgent` or specify.
*   [ ] **Data Pipeline:**
    *   [ ] Call `fetch_historical_data(TICKER, START_DATE, END_DATE)`. Handle potential empty DataFrame return.
    *   [ ] Instantiate `TechnicalAnalyzer` (if it's a class) or call its processing function.
    *   [ ] Call the analyzer function to add indicators (RSI, MACD, BBands) to the fetched data. Handle potential errors.
*   [ ] **Environment Setup:**
    *   [ ] Instantiate `TradingEnvironment`, passing the processed DataFrame and any other required parameters (e.g., `sharpe_window_size`).
*   [ ] **Agent Setup:**
    *   [ ] Get `state_size` and `action_size` from the initialized `env`.
    *   [ ] Instantiate `StrategyAgent` with the environment sizes and configured hyperparameters.
*   [ ] **Training Loop:**
    *   [ ] Implement a `for` loop iterating `TRAINING_EPISODES` times.
    *   [ ] Inside the loop:
        *   [ ] Reset the environment: `state, info = env.reset()`. Reshape `state` if necessary for the agent.
        *   [ ] Initialize episode variables (e.g., `total_reward = 0`, `done = False`).
        *   [ ] Implement a `while not done:` loop for steps within the episode.
        *   [ ] Agent selects action: `action = agent.select_action(state)`.
        *   [ ] Environment steps: `next_state, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)`.
        *   [ ] Combine termination flags: `done = terminated or truncated`.
        *   [ ] Reshape `next_state` if necessary.
        *   [ ] Agent remembers: `agent.remember(state, action, reward, next_state, done)`.
        *   [ ] Update state: `state = next_state`.
        *   [ ] Update total reward: `total_reward += reward`.
        *   [ ] Agent learns (conditionally): `agent.learn()`.
        *   [ ] Handle episode end (logging/printing).
    *   [ ] Print/log summary after each episode (e.g., `Episode: {episode+1}/{TRAINING_EPISODES}, Total Reward: {total_reward}, Epsilon: {agent.epsilon:.2f}`).
*   [ ] **Execution:**
    *   [ ] Ensure the script can be run (`python train.py`) and completes without critical errors for ~10 episodes.

## 3. Implementation Details üõ†Ô∏è

*   Place the script in the root directory for easy execution.
*   Handle state reshaping between the environment (Gymnasium standard) and the agent (expects specific shape for Keras model).
*   Use basic `print` statements for logging progress initially.

## 4. Checklist ü™ú

*   [ ] Create `train.py`.
*   [ ] Add imports and configuration parameters.
*   [ ] Implement data fetching call.
*   [ ] Implement technical analysis call.
*   [ ] Implement environment initialization.
*   [ ] Implement agent initialization.
*   [ ] Implement outer episode loop.
*   [ ] Implement inner step loop (action, step, remember, learn).
*   [ ] Add state reshaping logic.
*   [ ] Add episode progress printing.
*   [ ] Test run the script for a few episodes.
*   [ ] Ensure script completes without errors.
