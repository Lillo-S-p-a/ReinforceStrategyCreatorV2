# Master Investigation: Critical Training Pipeline Data Logging Failure

## 1. Description 📝

A critical issue is preventing any data (initial portfolio, PnL, trades, etc.) from being logged to the database during the training process. This problem emerged after a recent migration from TensorFlow to PyTorch, intended to enable parallel environment training. The porting appears to have broken multiple components in the data logging pipeline, primarily suspected to be within `reinforcestrategycreator/callbacks.py`.

**User Confirmed:**
*   `poetry lock && poetry install` has been executed after preliminary fixes (from `TASK-FIX-20250513-185800`) were applied.
*   A new training run was attempted.
*   **The data logging problem persists.**

## 2. Objective 🎯

The final objective is a fully functional training pipeline where:
*   There are no runtime errors or warnings related to data logging or callbacks.
*   All expected data (initial portfolio, PnL, trades, episode metrics) is logged correctly to the database.
*   The training pipeline is fully functional and supports parallelized execution as intended by the PyTorch migration.

## 3. Current Status & Linked Tasks 🔗

*   **`TASK-SOLVER-20250513-162000`**: "Refactor RLlib Integration for PyTorch Compatibility (Post-Migration)" - Status: `🟡 To Do`. Assigned to `dev-solver`. This is now the **primary active task** to address the core callback logic.
*   **`TASK-FIX-20250513-185800`**: "Investigate and Resolve Training Run Warnings and Callback Issues" - Status: `🟣 Review`. Assigned to `dev-fixer`. While individual warnings were addressed, the main data logging issue remains. This task's outcome is dependent on the `TASK-SOLVER` task.

## 4. Investigation Plan 🗺️

1.  **Delegate `TASK-SOLVER-20250513-162000` to `dev-solver` for immediate action.** This task involves a deep refactor of `reinforcestrategycreator/callbacks.py` to align with RLlib's PyTorch API.
2.  **Update `TASK-FIX-20250513-185800`:** Modify its status or add notes to indicate that its fixes were not sufficient for the primary data logging issue and that it awaits the outcome of `TASK-SOLVER-20250513-162000`.
3.  **Monitor Progress:** Closely track the progress of `dev-solver`.
4.  **Validate Fixes:** Once `dev-solver` completes `TASK-SOLVER-20250513-162000`, a thorough validation run of the training pipeline (`bash run_train.sh`) is required. This includes:
    *   Checking terminal output for errors/warnings.
    *   Examining `callbacks_debug.log`.
    *   **Verifying data in the database.**
    *   Running `check_episodes.py` and other relevant analysis scripts.
5.  **Further Diagnosis (If Necessary):** If data logging issues persist even after `TASK-SOLVER-20250513-162000` is completed and validated, new specific sub-tasks will be created to investigate:
    *   Database connection/transaction management within the PyTorch/parallel context.
    *   Data serialization/deserialization between components.
    *   Specific impacts of parallelization on data flow and logging.

## 5. Log & Communications 📓

*   All significant findings, decisions, and progress updates will be logged here and in the respective sub-tasks.
*   Regular status updates will be provided to the user.
