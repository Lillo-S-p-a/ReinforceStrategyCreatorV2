## üéØ Task Description

Despite previous attempts, the user continues to report a rendering error for a Mermaid diagram in the document [`docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md`](docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md) (specifically under the section "2.2. How It's Built: Overall Architecture"). This task is to **forcefully replace** the entire diagram block with the known-correct version using `apply_diff` to eliminate potential hidden characters or subtle syntax issues.

## Problem Details

The user reported the following persistent error:
```
Unable to render rich display

Parse error on line 2:
... A[Data Sources (Market Data)] --> B
----------------------^
Expecting 'SQE', 'DOUBLECIRCLEEND', 'PE', '-)', 'STADIUMEND', 'SUBROUTINEEND', 'PIPE', 'CYLINDEREND', 'DIAMOND_STOP', 'TAGEND', 'TRAPEND', 'INVTRAPEND', 'UNICODE_TEXT', 'TEXT', 'TAGSTART', got 'PS'
```

**Target File:** [`docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md`](docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md)
**Section:** "2.2. How It's Built: Overall Architecture"

**Diagram Block to Replace (Known Good Version):**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Data Sources (Market Data)] --> B(Data Processing & Preparation);
    B --> C(AI Training Engine);
    C --> D{AI Agent (The "Brain")};
    D -- Makes Decisions --> E(Simulated Market Environment);
    E -- Provides Feedback --> D;
    C -- Produces --> F(Trained Trading Strategy/Model);
    F --> G(Strategy Evaluation & Testing);
    G --> H[Performance Reports & Insights];

    style B fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#lightgreen,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#yellow,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#orange,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px

    style G fill:#lightgrey,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style H fill:#lime,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **Read File:** Use `read_file` to get the current content of [`docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md`](docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md).
2.  **Identify Block:** Accurately identify the start and end line numbers of the existing Mermaid diagram block under section "2.2. How It's Built: Overall Architecture". This block starts with ` ```mermaid ` and ends with ` ``` `.
3.  **Prepare Diff:**
    *   The `SEARCH` part of the diff should be the *exact content* of the diagram block currently in the file, from the line *after* ` ```mermaid ` up to the line *before* the closing ` ``` `.
    *   The `REPLACE` part of the diff should be the content of the **Diagram Block to Replace (Known Good Version)** provided above (excluding the ` ```mermaid ` and ` ``` ` delimiters themselves, as those lines are not part of the search/replace content, only the content *within* them).
4.  **Apply Fix:** Use the `apply_diff` tool to replace the identified diagram content.
5.  **Verify:** After applying the diff, conceptually verify that the diagram in the file now exactly matches the **Diagram Block to Replace (Known Good Version)**.

## ‚úÖ Checklist

- [x] Read [`docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md`](docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md) to get current content and line numbers.
- [x] Identify the exact start and end lines of the current diagram's content (between the ` ```mermaid ` and ` ``` ` lines).
- [x] Construct the `diff` payload for `apply_diff`.
- [x] Execute `apply_diff` to replace the diagram content. (Attempted: `apply_diff` reported no changes as source and target content were identical.)
- [x] Confirm the task completion.

## üìù Notes & Logs
*(Technical Writer to add logs here as work progresses)*
- 2025-05-31 12:32: Read target file [`docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md`](docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md). Identified diagram content from lines 34-51.
- 2025-05-31 12:32: Attempted `apply_diff` with the known good diagram content. The tool reported that the existing content was identical to the replacement content, so no changes were made. The diagram in the document textually matches the correct version. If rendering issues persist, they are likely not due to the textual content of this specific Mermaid block.
