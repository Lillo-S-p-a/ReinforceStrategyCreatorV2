## üéØ Task Description

The user continues to report a rendering error for the Mermaid diagram in [`docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md`](docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md) (section "2.2. How It's Built: Overall Architecture"), even after confirming the diagram's internal content is correct. This task is to ensure the ` ```mermaid ` and ` ``` ` delimiter lines are clean (no leading/trailing whitespace) and that there is a blank line immediately before the opening ` ```mermaid ` and immediately after the closing ` ``` `.

## Problem Details

The persistent error suggests the issue might not be the diagram code itself, but the way the block is delimited or interacts with surrounding Markdown.

**Target File:** [`docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md`](docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md)
**Section:** "2.2. How It's Built: Overall Architecture"

**Correct Diagram Content (for reference, not to be changed unless the delimiters are part of it):**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Data Sources (Market Data)] --> B(Data Processing & Preparation);
    B --> C(AI Training Engine);
    C --> D{AI Agent (The "Brain")};
    D -- Makes Decisions --> E(Simulated Market Environment);
    E -- Provides Feedback --> D;
    C -- Produces --> F(Trained Trading Strategy/Model);
    F --> G(Strategy Evaluation & Testing);
    G --> H[Performance Reports & Insights];

    style C fill:#lightgreen,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px

    style G fill:#lightgrey,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style H fill:#lime,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **Read File:** Use `read_file` to get the current content of [`docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md`](docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md).
2.  **Locate Diagram Block:** Identify the Mermaid diagram under section "2.2. How It's Built: Overall Architecture".
3.  **Inspect Delimiters & Surrounding Lines:**
    *   Check the line containing ` ```mermaid `. Ensure there are no spaces before ` ``` ` or after `mermaid`.
    *   Check the line containing the closing ` ``` `. Ensure there are no spaces before or after it.
    *   Ensure there is one blank line immediately *before* the ` ```mermaid ` line.
    *   Ensure there is one blank line immediately *after* the closing ` ``` ` line.
4.  **Apply Fixes (if needed):** Use `apply_diff` to make any necessary corrections to the delimiter lines or the blank lines surrounding the block.
    *   Example: If the line is `  ```mermaid  `, it should become ```` ```mermaid ````.
    *   Example: If there's no blank line before, insert one.
5.  **If no changes are needed** because the delimiters and surrounding blank lines are already perfect, note this in the logs.

## ‚úÖ Checklist

- [ ] Read [`docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md`](docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md).
- [ ] Locate the target Mermaid diagram block.
- [ ] Inspect delimiter lines for leading/trailing whitespace.
- [ ] Inspect for blank lines immediately before and after the block.
- [ ] Prepare and apply `diff` if any corrections are needed.
- [ ] Log actions and findings.
