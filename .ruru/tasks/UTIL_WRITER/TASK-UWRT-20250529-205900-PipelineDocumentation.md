# Implement Task 7.3: Comprehensive Documentation for ReinforceStrategyCreator Pipeline

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

*   **What is this feature?** This task is to implement **Task 7.3: Documentation** as defined in the Model Pipeline Implementation Plan ([`.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md`](.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md:359)). The objective is to create comprehensive documentation for the newly developed `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline`.
*   **Why is it needed?** To provide developers, users, and operators with the necessary information to understand, use, maintain, and extend the pipeline.
*   **Scope (from Implementation Plan - Task 7.3):**
    *   Generate/write API documentation.
    *   Create user guides.
    *   Create deployment guides.
    *   Update existing architecture documentation if necessary.
*   **Links:**
    *   Project Plan: [`.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md#task-73-documentation`](.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md:359)
    *   Existing Architecture Doc: [`.ruru/docs/architecture/model_pipeline_v1_architecture.md`](.ruru/docs/architecture/model_pipeline_v1_architecture.md)

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

(Derived from Implementation Plan - Task 7.3 Deliverables & Details)
*   - [‚úÖ] API documentation for all major modules and classes in `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/` is generated and/or written (e.g., using Sphinx or similar). (Fixes completed by `dev-python` in [`TASK-DEVPY-20250529-214700-APIDocFix.md`](.ruru/tasks/DEV_PYTHON/TASK-DEVPY-20250529-214700-APIDocFix.md))
*   - [‚úÖ] User guides are created, explaining how to:
    *   - [‚úÖ] Configure the pipeline.
    *   - [‚úÖ] Run the pipeline for training, evaluation, and deployment.
    *   - [‚úÖ] Interpret results and reports.
*   - [‚úÖ] Deployment guides are created, detailing:
    *   - [‚úÖ] How to set up different deployment environments (local, paper trading).
    *   - [‚úÖ] How to deploy new models using the `DeploymentManager`.
    *   - [‚úÖ] How to monitor deployed models.
*   - [‚úÖ] The existing architecture document ([`.ruru/docs/architecture/model_pipeline_v1_architecture.md`](.ruru/docs/architecture/model_pipeline_v1_architecture.md)) is reviewed and updated to reflect the final implemented system.
*   - [‚úÖ] Documentation includes configuration examples.
*   - [‚úÖ] Troubleshooting guides for common issues are provided.
*   - [‚úÖ] `dev-python` should provide support for explaining code details and functionalities. (Initial support provided, further specific fixes delegated)

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks üìù

*   - [‚úÖ] **API Documentation:** (Fixes completed by `dev-python`)
    *   - [‚úÖ] Set up a tool for auto-generating API documentation from Python docstrings (e.g., Sphinx with `sphinx-apidoc`).
    *   - [‚úÖ] Ensure all public modules, classes, and functions in `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/` have clear and comprehensive docstrings. (Completed by `dev-python`)
    *   - [‚úÖ] Generate the API documentation and integrate it into the overall documentation structure. (Completed by `dev-python`)
*   - [‚úÖ] **User Guides:**
    *   - [‚úÖ] Outline the structure for user guides (e.g., Getting Started, Configuration, Running the Pipeline, Understanding Outputs).
    *   - [‚úÖ] Write step-by-step instructions for key user workflows.
    *   - [‚úÖ] Include examples of configuration files and command-line usage.
*   - [‚úÖ] **Deployment Guides:**
    *   - [‚úÖ] Document the setup for local development and paper trading environments.
    *   - [‚úÖ] Explain the usage of `DeploymentManager` and `ModelPackager`.
    *   - [‚úÖ] Detail how to use the `PaperTradingDeployer`.
    *   - [‚úÖ] Provide guidance on interpreting monitoring dashboards and alerts.
*   - [‚úÖ] **Architecture Documentation Update:**
    *   - [‚úÖ] Review [`.ruru/docs/architecture/model_pipeline_v1_architecture.md`](.ruru/docs/architecture/model_pipeline_v1_architecture.md).
    *   - [‚úÖ] Update diagrams and descriptions to accurately reflect the implemented components and their interactions.
*   - [‚úÖ] **Configuration Examples & Troubleshooting:**
    *   - [‚úÖ] Compile a set of common configuration examples.
    *   - [‚úÖ] Create a troubleshooting section addressing potential common problems and their solutions.
*   - [‚úÖ] Coordinate with `dev-python` to clarify technical details of components as needed. (Delegation for API doc fixes created: [`TASK-DEVPY-20250529-214700-APIDocFix.md`](.ruru/tasks/DEV_PYTHON/TASK-DEVPY-20250529-214700-APIDocFix.md))
*   - [‚úÖ] Organize all documentation into a clear and navigable structure (e.g., within the `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/docs/` directory).
