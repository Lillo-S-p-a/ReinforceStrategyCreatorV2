## üéØ Task Description

The user continues to report a rendering error for the Mermaid diagram in [`docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md`](docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md) (section "2.2. How It's Built: Overall Architecture"). The error message points to the line defining node `B`. A potential cause for the renderer's parsing issue could be the ampersand (`&`) in the node text "Data Processing & Preparation".

This task is to modify the diagram by replacing `&` with `and` in that specific node.

## Problem Details

**Target File:** [`docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md`](docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md)
**Section:** "2.2. How It's Built: Overall Architecture"

**Current problematic line (within the diagram):**
`    A[Data Sources (Market Data)] --> B(Data Processing & Preparation);`

**Targeted change:**
Modify node `B`'s text from `Data Processing & Preparation` to `Data Processing and Preparation`.

**The corrected line should be:**
`    A[Data Sources (Market Data)] --> B(Data Processing and Preparation);`

**Full diagram with the proposed change:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Data Sources (Market Data)] --> B(Data Processing and Preparation);
    B --> C(AI Training Engine);
    C --> D{AI Agent (The "Brain")};
    D -- Makes Decisions --> E(Simulated Market Environment);
    E -- Provides Feedback --> D;
    C -- Produces --> F(Trained Trading Strategy/Model);
    F --> G(Strategy Evaluation & Testing);
    G --> H[Performance Reports & Insights];

    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#lightgreen,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#yellow,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#orange,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#lightblue,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style G fill:#lightgrey,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style H fill:#lime,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **Read File:** Use `read_file` to get the current content of [`docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md`](docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md).
2.  **Locate Diagram Block:** Identify the Mermaid diagram under section "2.2. How It's Built: Overall Architecture".
3.  **Prepare Diff:** Create a diff to change the line:
    `    A[Data Sources (Market Data)] --> B(Data Processing & Preparation);`
    to:
    `    A[Data Sources (Market Data)] --> B(Data Processing and Preparation);`
    Ensure the line number for the search is correct.
4.  **Apply Fix:** Use the `apply_diff` tool to make the targeted change.
5.  **Verify:** After applying the diff, conceptually verify that only the ampersand was replaced with "and" in the specified line.

## ‚úÖ Checklist

- [ ] Read [`docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md`](docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md).
- [ ] Locate the target line within the Mermaid diagram.
- [ ] Construct the `diff` payload for `apply_diff`.
- [ ] Execute `apply_diff` to replace `&` with `and`.
- [ ] Log actions and findings.
