## üéØ Task Description

Generate a comprehensive, single-document explanation of the ReinforceStrategyCreator system. This document must be specifically tailored for a **non-Machine Learning expert audience** (e.g., quant analysts, hedge fund managers without deep ML backgrounds).

The document should clearly elucidate:
1.  How the system operates.
2.  How its models are trained and selected.
3.  Potential future improvements or next steps for the system.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   **Output:** A single Markdown file. Suggested path: `docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md`.
*   **Language & Tone:**
    *   Clear, accessible, and jargon-free.
    *   Use analogies and straightforward descriptions to ensure all concepts are understandable to a non-technical reader.
    *   Prioritize intuitive explanations over technical depth where appropriate for the target audience.
*   **Content Coverage:**
    *   **System Overview:**
        *   Purpose of the system.
        *   Overall architecture (illustrate with a Mermaid diagram).
        *   Key components and their roles.
        *   Data flow through the system (illustrate with a Mermaid diagram).
    *   **Model Training & Selection (Simplified):**
        *   Data sources used.
        *   Simplified explanation of data preprocessing steps.
        *   Core concepts of the RL training process (e.g., agent, environment, reward, learning by trial-and-error) explained intuitively.
        *   Evaluation metrics (e.g., Sharpe Ratio, Max Drawdown) explained in simple terms, focusing on what they indicate about strategy performance.
        *   Rationale behind model selection (how "good" models are chosen).
    *   **Future Enhancements & Next Steps:**
        *   Outline potential future improvements for the system.
        *   Suggest actionable next steps for users or stakeholders.
*   **Visual Aids:**
    *   Integrate illustrative **Mermaid diagrams** (e.g., for system architecture, data flow).
    *   Include simplified **LaTeX formulas** *only if they significantly aid understanding* for concepts like Sharpe Ratio. Each formula **must** be accompanied by an intuitive, non-technical explanation of what it represents and why it's useful.
*   **Referenced Materials:**
    *   Utilize the existing structured documentation at [`docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_pipeline_docs/`](docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_pipeline_docs/index.md).
    *   Refer to the original pipeline documentation at [`.ruru/docs/pipeline/reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline_v1.md`](.ruru/docs/pipeline/reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline_v1.md).
    *   Consider the existing [`docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_pipeline_docs/overview_for_quants_managers.md`](docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_pipeline_docs/overview_for_quants_managers.md) as a starting point for tone and audience focus, but this new document should be much more comprehensive.

## ‚úÖ Checklist

- [‚úÖ] Draft the overall structure of the document.
- [‚úÖ] Write the "System Overview" section with Mermaid diagrams.
- [‚úÖ] Write the "Model Training & Selection (Simplified)" section, including intuitive explanations for metrics and any LaTeX formulas.
- [‚úÖ] Write the "Future Enhancements & Next Steps" section.
- [‚úÖ] Review the entire document for clarity, accuracy, and adherence to non-technical language.
- [‚úÖ] Ensure all Mermaid diagrams render correctly and are easy to understand.
- [‚úÖ] Ensure all LaTeX formulas (if any) are simple and well-explained.
- [‚úÖ] Save the final document to `docs/reinforce_strategy_creator_for_non_experts.md`.
