# Fix NULL values in 'steps' database table

## üìù Description

The `steps` database table, as observed by the user (see provided image), is showing `NULL` values for several critical columns: `portfolio_value`, `asset_price`, `action`, and `position`. This indicates an issue in the data capture or storage logic within the trading simulation. The primary suspect for this logic is the `step()` method within [`reinforcestrategycreator/trading_environment.py`](reinforcestrategycreator/trading_environment.py), but related database utility functions (e.g., in [`reinforcestrategycreator/db_utils.py`](reinforcestrategycreator/db_utils.py)) or model definitions ([`reinforcestrategycreator/db_models.py`](reinforcestrategycreator/db_models.py)) might also be involved.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

1.  The `portfolio_value` column in the `steps` table is populated with correct, non-NULL floating-point values representing the portfolio's value at each step.
2.  The `asset_price` column in the `steps` table is populated with correct, non-NULL floating-point values representing the asset's price at each step.
3.  The `action` column in the `steps` table is populated with correct, non-NULL values (e.g., string or integer representation) reflecting the agent's action taken at each step.
4.  The `position` column in the `steps` table is populated with correct, non-NULL values (e.g., string or integer representation) reflecting the agent's market position after the action at each step.
5.  The fix is primarily implemented in [`reinforcestrategycreator/trading_environment.py`](reinforcestrategycreator/trading_environment.py), with any necessary adjustments in related data handling or database interaction modules.
6.  The solution ensures data integrity for these fields for all new steps recorded.
7.  No existing functionality is broken (no regressions).

## üìã Checklist

-   [‚úÖ] **Analysis:**
    -   [‚úÖ] Review the `step()` method in [`reinforcestrategycreator/trading_environment.py`](reinforcestrategycreator/trading_environment.py) to understand how `portfolio_value`, `asset_price`, `action`, and `position` are currently calculated and prepared for storage.
    -   [‚úÖ] Identify the exact point where these values are (or should be) passed to the database insertion/update mechanism for the `steps` table. (Identified as `on_episode_step` in `callbacks.py`)
    -   [‚úÖ] Check if the values are `None` before being saved, or if the issue lies in the database interaction itself. (Issue was in `callbacks.py` not using the values from `info` dict)
    -   [‚úÖ] Examine [`reinforcestrategycreator/db_utils.py`](reinforcestrategycreator/db_utils.py) and [`reinforcestrategycreator/db_models.py`](reinforcestrategycreator/db_models.py) for any discrepancies in how `Step` objects are created or committed. (`db_models.py` confirmed fields exist; `db_utils.py` less relevant here)
-   [‚úÖ] **Implementation:**
    -   [‚úÖ] Modify the code to correctly calculate or retrieve `portfolio_value` at each step. (Ensured correct value from `info` dict is used in `callbacks.py`)
    -   [‚úÖ] Modify the code to correctly record the `asset_price` used for calculations at each step. (Ensured correct value from `info` dict is used in `callbacks.py`)
    -   [‚úÖ] Ensure the agent's `action` is captured and stored. (Ensured correct value from `info` dict is used in `callbacks.py`)
    -   [‚úÖ] Ensure the agent's resulting `position` (e.g., long, short, flat, or quantity) is captured and stored. (Ensured correct value from `info` dict is used in `callbacks.py`)
    -   [‚úÖ] Update the database saving logic to include these non-NULL values. (Modified `DbStep` instantiation in `callbacks.py`)
-   [ ] **Verification:**
    -   [‚úÖ] After implementing the fix, run a short training or simulation. (Completed by Roo Commander 2025-05-15 12:59 UTC)
    -   [‚úÖ] Query the `steps` table to confirm that new entries have valid, non-NULL data for `portfolio_value`, `asset_price`, `action`, and `position`. (Verified with `verify_steps_fix.py` for run `RLlibDBG-SPY-20250515105755-6f797c51`)
    -   [‚úÖ] Manually verify a few entries to ensure the values are logical in the context of the simulation. (Sample output from `verify_steps_fix.py` shows logical values)
-   [ ] **Testing:**
    -   [ ] Consider if any existing unit tests need updates or if new tests are required for this specific data logging.
-   [ ] **Documentation & Cleanup:**
    -   [ ] Add comments to the code if the fix involves complex logic.
    -   [ ] Ensure code formatting and style guidelines are followed.
