# Task: Implement Metrics Calculation Logic & DB Integration

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Implement the Python logic to calculate all performance metrics defined in `.ruru/docs/metrics_definitions.md` and integrate this logic into the existing training (`train.py`) and analysis (`analyze_results.py`) workflows, storing the results in the PostgreSQL database using the provided utilities (`db_utils.py`, `db_models.py`).

## ðŸ“– Description

The project now has a PostgreSQL database schema (`db_models.py`) and connection utilities (`db_utils.py`) for storing performance metrics. This task involves modifying the Python codebase to:

1.  **Calculate Metrics:** Implement functions or methods to calculate each metric listed in the checklist below, based on the definitions in `.ruru/docs/metrics_definitions.md`. Use data available during or after training/simulation runs (e.g., portfolio history, step rewards, trade data).
2.  **Identify Trade Data:** The current `TradingEnv` or `train.py` might not explicitly track individual trades (entry/exit). Modify the environment or training loop to capture necessary trade details (entry/exit price, time, quantity, costs) required for PnL (trade-based), Win Rate, and Trade Frequency. Store this in the `trades` DB table.
3.  **Integrate Calculations:**
    *   Modify `train.py`:
        *   At the start of a run, create a record in the `training_runs` table.
        *   During the episode loop, collect step data (portfolio value, reward, action, etc.) and insert it into the `steps` table using the DB utilities.
        *   Capture and insert closed trades into the `trades` table.
        *   At the end of each episode, calculate episode-summary metrics (PnL, Sharpe, MDD, Reward, Steps, Win Rate, etc.) and insert/update a record in the `episodes` table.
        *   At the end of the run, update the `training_runs` record with completion time, etc.
    *   Modify `analyze_results.py` (if applicable): If analysis involves recalculating or aggregating metrics from raw data (like the old CSV), adapt it to query the database instead.
4.  **Use DB Utilities:** Utilize the functions/session management provided in `reinforcestrategycreator/db_utils.py` for all database interactions. Ensure connections are handled correctly.
5.  **Refactor (If Needed):** Refactor existing code in `train.py`, `analyze_results.py`, or `trading_environment.py` as necessary to cleanly integrate the calculation and database logging logic. Aim for modularity.

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria

*   Calculation logic for all specified metrics is implemented in Python.
*   Trade data (entry/exit) is captured during simulation.
*   `train.py` correctly logs run metadata, episode summaries, step data, and trade data to the respective database tables using the provided utilities.
*   `analyze_results.py` (if modified) correctly queries the database for analysis.
*   Calculations align with the definitions in `.ruru/docs/metrics_definitions.md`.
*   Code is reasonably efficient and follows Python best practices.
*   Database interactions are handled correctly (sessions, commits, error handling).

## ðŸ“‹ Checklist

*   [ ] Implement logic to capture individual trade data (entry/exit times, prices, quantity, costs).
*   [ ] Implement DB logging for `training_runs` at the start/end of `train.py`.
*   [ ] Implement DB logging for `steps` data within the episode loop in `train.py`.
*   [ ] Implement DB logging for `trades` data within the episode loop or environment.
*   [ ] Implement calculation logic for PnL (episode summary).
*   [ ] Implement calculation logic for Total Reward (episode summary).
*   [ ] Implement calculation logic for Sharpe Ratio (episode summary).
*   [ ] Implement calculation logic for Max Drawdown (episode summary).
*   [ ] Implement calculation logic for Win Rate (episode summary).
*   [ ] Implement calculation logic for Trade Frequency (episode summary).
*   [ ] Implement calculation logic for Success Rate (episode summary).
*   [ ] Implement calculation logic for Steps Per Episode (episode summary).
*   [ ] Implement calculation logic for Resource Consumption metrics (Training Time - logged in `training_runs`). (CPU/Memory are optional, skip unless trivial).
*   [ ] Implement DB logging for `episodes` table at the end of each episode in `train.py`.
*   [ ] Refactor `analyze_results.py` to use DB data if necessary.
*   [ ] Ensure DB sessions/connections are managed correctly.
*   [ ] Review code for clarity and efficiency.
