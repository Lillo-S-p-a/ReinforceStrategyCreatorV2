# Fix Model Selection Test Script Errors

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

* **What is this feature?** Fix multiple errors in the test script that validates our model selection improvements
* **Why is it needed?** The test script currently fails with several errors, preventing proper validation of our enhanced model selection approach
* **Scope:** Address all error conditions identified in the test run logs, focusing on fixing key errors related to metric names, data issues, and results structure
* **Links:** Error log provided by the user shows the exact issues to be fixed

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

* - [ ] Fix the `KeyError: 'total_pnl'` issues in all locations 
* - [ ] Fix the sample data generation to prevent "Input DataFrame is empty or missing 'high', 'low', or 'close' columns" errors
* - [ ] Address the "Not enough qualified models for ensemble" warning by implementing proper handling
* - [ ] Fix the `KeyError: 'best_model_info'` error in the comparison report generation
* - [ ] Ensure the test completes successfully end-to-end
* - [ ] Add proper error handling and fallbacks throughout the test script

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks üìù

* - [ ] Update all references from `'total_pnl'` to the correct key name (likely `'pnl'` based on other code)
* - [ ] Enhance the `create_sample_data` function to ensure it generates data with all required columns and valid values
* - [ ] Implement proper handling for the ensemble case when not enough qualified models are found
* - [ ] Fix the comparison report generation to properly handle cases where some approaches encountered errors
* - [ ] Add try/except blocks with appropriate fallbacks in key sections
* - [ ] Test the script with the corrected code to validate all fixes

## Error Details and Context üêõ

The test script is currently failing with these key errors:

1. Key Error in multiple reports:
```
KeyError: 'total_pnl'
```
This appears in all approaches (original, enhanced, and ablation studies). The correct key name needs to be identified and fixed.

2. Data issues:
```
CalculationError: Input DataFrame is empty or missing 'high', 'low', or 'close' columns (case-insensitive)
```
Sample data generation needs enhancement to ensure all required columns are present and properly populated.

3. Ensemble model error:
```
Not enough qualified models for ensemble (found 0)
```
We need proper handling when ensemble creation fails.

4. Report generation error:
```
KeyError: 'best_model_info'
```
The comparison report generation fails because previous errors prevented proper population of the results.
