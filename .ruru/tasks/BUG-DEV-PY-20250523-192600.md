# Fix CV Reporting and Visualization Errors in Model Selection Test

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

*   **What is the problem?** The model selection test script (`test_model_selection_improvements.py`) encounters errors during the cross-validation (CV) reporting and visualization phase. Specifically, an `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'pivot'` occurs when trying to visualize CV performance. Additionally, the final comparison report shows all CV metrics as zero, and the `enhanced_cv_report.txt` states "No CV results available."
*   **Where does it occur?**
    *   The `AttributeError` occurs in the `_visualize_cv_performance` method within `test_model_selection_improvements.py` (or potentially in `Visualizer` class if the logic is there).
    *   The zero CV metrics issue appears in the final `approach_comparison.csv` generated by `generate_comparison_report` in `test_model_selection_improvements.py`.
*   **Impact:** We cannot properly assess the cross-validation performance of different model configurations, which is crucial for understanding model robustness and for validating the HPO process. The main comparison report is misleading due to the missing CV data.

## Steps to Reproduce üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

1.  Ensure HPO implementation and previous bug fixes (BUG-DEV-PY-20250523-173800) are in place.
2.  Run the full model selection test with HPO enabled: `./run_model_selection_with_hpo.sh`.
3.  Observe the error log for `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'pivot'`.
4.  Inspect `test_results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/approach_comparison.csv` and note that all "CV Sharpe", "CV PnL ($)", etc., columns are zero.
5.  Inspect `test_results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/enhanced_cv_report.txt` (or similar) and note it contains "No CV results available."

## Expected Behavior ‚úÖ

*   The `_visualize_cv_performance` method should correctly generate CV performance heatmaps and parallel coordinate plots without errors.
*   The `enhanced_cv_report.txt` (or `.csv`) should contain detailed results from each CV fold and hyperparameter trial.
*   The `approach_comparison.csv` should display meaningful, non-zero average CV metrics for each tested approach.

## Actual Behavior ‚ùå

*   An `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'pivot'` occurs during CV visualization.
*   The `enhanced_cv_report.txt` indicates no CV results are available.
*   All CV columns in `approach_comparison.csv` are zero.

## Environment Details üñ•Ô∏è (Optional - Use if not in TOML)

*   Occurs after running HPO and model selection tests.
*   Involves Pandas DataFrame operations.

## Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done) ‚úÖ

*   - [‚úÖ] The `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'pivot'` in CV visualization is resolved.
*   - [‚úÖ] The `cv_report` object passed to visualization methods is a Pandas DataFrame with the expected structure, not a string.
*   - [‚úÖ] The `enhanced_cv_report.txt` (or `.csv`) is correctly populated with detailed CV results.
*   - [‚úÖ] The `approach_comparison.csv` correctly calculates and displays average CV metrics for all approaches.
*   - [‚úÖ] CV performance visualizations (heatmap, parallel coordinates plot) are generated successfully.

## Implementation Notes / Root Cause Analysis üìù

*   **Pivot Error:** The `AttributeError` suggests that the `cv_report` variable, expected to be a DataFrame, is actually a string (possibly an error message or a path) when `_visualize_cv_performance` is called. Trace back where `self.enhanced_results['cv_report']` is populated and what `workflow.cross_validator.generate_cv_report()` returns, especially in error cases.
*   **Zero CV Metrics:** This is likely a knock-on effect of the `cv_report` issue. If the CV data isn't correctly processed or available as a DataFrame, the aggregation for the summary report will fail or use default (zero) values.
*   **`generate_cv_report()` Return Type:** Investigate `CrossValidator.generate_cv_report()` in `reinforcestrategycreator/backtesting/cross_validation.py`. Ensure it consistently returns a DataFrame or `None` (which should be handled gracefully), rather than a string error message. If it can return an error string, the calling code in `test_model_selection_improvements.py` needs to check the type before attempting DataFrame operations.

## Log Entries ü™µ

*   2025-05-23 19:26:00 - Task created by Roo Commander to fix CV reporting and visualization issues.
*   2025-05-23 19:53:08 - Task completed by Python Developer.
    *   Added `generate_cv_dataframe()` to `CrossValidator` to ensure a DataFrame is returned.
    *   Modified `run_enhanced_approach()` in `test_model_selection_improvements.py` to store both text and DataFrame CV results.
    *   Updated `_visualize_cv_performance()` to handle different input types and added error handling.
    *   Updated metrics extraction to correctly calculate average CV metrics from the DataFrame.
    *   CV visualizations and reports are now generated correctly.
