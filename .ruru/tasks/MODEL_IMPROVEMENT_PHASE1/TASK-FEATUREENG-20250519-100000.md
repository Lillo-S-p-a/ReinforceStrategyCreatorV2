# Feature Engineering Framework for Model Improvement

## Description

Create the core feature engineering framework for the model improvement project. This task involves setting up the project structure, designing the feature engineering pipeline, implementing the base classes and interfaces for feature calculation, and developing the configuration system.

This is the foundational task for Phase 1 of the model improvement project, which will be built upon by subsequent tasks focused on specific feature types and data preparation methods.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Project directory structure is created following the defined architecture
- [ ] Base feature engineering module with extensible interfaces is implemented
- [ ] Configuration system for feature parameters is created
- [ ] Feature calculation pipeline with proper input/output handling is implemented
- [ ] Base data preprocessing utilities are created
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests for the framework components are written
- [ ] Documentation for the feature engineering framework is complete

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Create project structure
  - [ ] Set up `reinforcestrategycreator/model_improvement/` directory
  - [ ] Create subdirectories for each module
  - [ ] Create `__init__.py` files for proper imports

- [ ] Implement configuration system
  - [ ] Create base configuration file with parameters
  - [ ] Implement configuration loading and validation
  - [ ] Create environment variable overrides for key parameters

- [ ] Design feature engineering architecture
  - [ ] Create base Feature class/interface
  - [ ] Define FeatureProcessor interface
  - [ ] Implement FeaturePipeline for sequential processing

- [ ] Develop data preprocessing utilities
  - [ ] Create data normalization functions
  - [ ] Implement data windowing utilities
  - [ ] Create data splitting utilities (train/validation/test)

- [ ] Implement feature calculation framework
  - [ ] Create base indicator calculation framework
  - [ ] Implement feature vector composition
  - [ ] Create feature validation utilities

- [ ] Write comprehensive tests
  - [ ] Unit tests for all components
  - [ ] Integration tests for the pipeline
  - [ ] Performance benchmarks

- [ ] Create documentation
  - [ ] API documentation with examples
  - [ ] Architecture diagram
  - [ ] Usage guidelines

## Dependencies

* Python 3.9 or higher
* NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation
* PyTorch for tensor operations
* TA-Lib for technical indicator calculation (if needed)
* Access to historical price data for testing

## Notes

This task establishes the foundation for all subsequent feature engineering tasks. The architecture should be designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing for easy addition of new features and modification of existing ones.

Pay special attention to the following aspects:
1. Performance optimization for feature calculation
2. Clear interfaces for adding new features
3. Proper error handling and validation
4. Comprehensive documentation
