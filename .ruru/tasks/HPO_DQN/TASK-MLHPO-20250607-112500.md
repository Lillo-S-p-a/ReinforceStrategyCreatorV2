# Run Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) for DQN Model

## Description ✍️

*   **What is this feature?** This task involves executing the Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) process for the DQN model to identify an optimal set of hyperparameters.
*   **Why is it needed?** The current DQN model, while functional, is not yet performing well. HPO is a critical step to improve its learning capability and overall trading strategy performance.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Configure and run an HPO experiment for the DQN model using the existing `HPOptimizer` and relevant configurations.
    *   Analyze the HPO results to determine the best hyperparameter set.
    *   The actual retraining of the model with these new hyperparameters will be a subsequent task.
*   **Links:**
    *   HPO Configuration: [`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/configs/base/hpo.yaml`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/configs/base/hpo.yaml)
    *   HPO Logic: [`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/training/hpo_optimizer.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/training/hpo_optimizer.py)
    *   Example HPO script: [`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/examples/hpo_example.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/examples/hpo_example.py)
    *   DQN Model: [`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/models/implementations/dqn.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/models/implementations/dqn.py)

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

*   - [ ] An HPO experiment for the DQN model is successfully configured and executed.
*   - [ ] The HPO experiment uses an appropriate preset (e.g., "quick_test" for initial validation, then potentially "standard" from [`hpo.yaml`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/configs/base/hpo.yaml:1)).
*   - [ ] The HPO process utilizes actual project data as defined in the main pipeline configurations (e.g., from [`pipeline.yaml`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/configs/base/pipeline.yaml)), not just sample data.
*   - [ ] The results of the HPO run (e.g., path to the `..._results.json` file) are saved and reported.
*   - [ ] The best set of hyperparameters for the DQN model, as determined by the HPO process, is clearly identified and reported.
*   - [ ] A brief summary of the HPO run (e.g., number of trials, best score) is provided.

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks 📝

*   - [ ] **Setup HPO Script:**
    *   Adapt the existing [`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/examples/hpo_example.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/examples/hpo_example.py:1) or create a new script specifically for running HPO on the DQN model.
    *   This script should correctly initialize `ConfigLoader`, `DataManager`, `TrainingEngine`, and `HPOptimizer`.
*   - [ ] **Configure Data Source:**
    *   Ensure the `data_config` for the HPO run correctly references the project's actual data sources (e.g., by loading configurations from [`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/configs/base/pipeline.yaml`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/configs/base/pipeline.yaml) and extracting the relevant data source ID and parameters for the `DataManager`).
    *   The HPO process should train on the same data features as the main pipeline.
*   - [ ] **Configure HPO Experiment:**
    *   Set the `model_config` to target the "dqn" model type.
    *   Use the "dqn" `search_spaces` and `param_mappings` from [`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/configs/base/hpo.yaml`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/configs/base/hpo.yaml:1).
    *   Select an appropriate HPO experiment preset (e.g., `quick_test` initially, then potentially `standard`). Specify `num_trials`, `search_algorithm`, `scheduler`, `metric` (e.g., "val_loss"), and `mode` (e.g., "min").
*   - [ ] **Execute HPO Run:**
    *   Run the configured HPO script.
    *   Monitor the execution for any errors.
*   - [ ] **Collect and Report Results:**
    *   Once the HPO run is complete, identify the path to the generated results JSON file (e.g., in `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/hpo_results/`).
    *   Report this path.
    *   Use `hpo_optimizer.analyze_results()` or manually inspect the results file to identify and report the `best_params` and `best_score`.

**2025-06-07 14:16:32** - HPO Script Execution Completed with Critical Issue
- ✅ Successfully executed HPO script with all dependency fixes applied
- ✅ Ray Tune infrastructure initialized correctly (5 trials, quick_test preset)
- ✅ Model factory registration working in distributed workers
- ✅ All import path issues resolved (scipy, sklearn, yfinance dependencies)
- ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED**: All 5 trials failed with "No training data provided" error
- 📊 HPO Results Location: `/home/alessio/Personal/ReinforceStrategyCreatorV2/reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/hpo_results/dqn/dqn_hpo_quick_test`
- 🔍 Root Cause: Data loading pipeline in TrainingEngine._load_data() method failing
- 📋 Error Details: `ValueError: No training data provided` in engine.py line 265
- 🚫 Task Status: Changed to "⚪ Blocked" - requires data pipeline investigation before HPO can proceed

**Technical Analysis:**
- HPO infrastructure is fully functional and ready
- All previous import/dependency issues have been resolved
- The blocking issue is in the data preparation/loading phase
- Need to investigate DataManager.load_data() and TrainingEngine._load_data() integration
- This is a separate data pipeline issue, not an HPO-specific problem
**2025-06-07 14:35:00** - Data Pipeline Issue Resolved
- ✅ The blocking data pipeline issue (ValueError: No training data provided) has been resolved by `dev-python` specialist in task [`TASK-PYDEV-20250607-142500`](.ruru/tasks/DATA_PIPELINE_FIX/TASK-PYDEV-20250607-142500.md).
- ✅ [`YFinanceDataSource.load_data()`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/data/yfinance_source.py) now has robust error handling.
- ➡️ HPO task is unblocked and ready for re-execution.
- 📋 Task Status: Changed from "⚪ Blocked" to "🟡 To Do".

**2025-06-07 14:43:40** - Import Path Issues Resolved, Data Pipeline Issue Persists
- ✅ **Import Path Fixes Completed**: All absolute import path issues have been systematically resolved:
  * Fixed `yfinance_source.py` line 8: `from reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline.src.monitoring.logger import get_logger` → `from ..monitoring.logger import get_logger`
  * Fixed `transformer.py` line 16: `from reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline.src.config.models import TransformationConfig` → `from ..config.models import TransformationConfig`
  * Fixed `validator.py` line 11: `from reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline.src.config.models import ValidationConfig` → `from ..config.models import ValidationConfig`
- ✅ **Virtual Environment Setup**: Created and configured `.venv` with all required dependencies including numpy 1.26.4 for compatibility
- ✅ **HPO Infrastructure Verified**: Ray Tune successfully initializes and runs 5 trials with proper distributed worker setup
- ❌ **Data Pipeline Issue Persists**: Despite previous fix, all HPO trials still fail with "No training data provided" error
- 🔍 **Root Cause**: The YFinance error handling improvements are working (fast failures ~0.002s), but the underlying data fetching is still failing
- 📊 **HPO Results**: Located at `/home/alessio/Personal/ReinforceStrategyCreatorV2/reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/hpo_results/dqn/dqn_hpo_quick_test`
- 🚫 **Current Status**: Task remains blocked - need to investigate actual data source configuration and YFinance API connectivity
**2025-06-07 16:07:07** - ✅ HPO Infrastructure Successfully Executed with Virtual Environment
- ✅ **Virtual Environment Activation**: Successfully activated `.venv` using dot notation (`. .venv/bin/activate`)
- ✅ **Ray Tune Execution**: All 5 trials initialized and executed with proper hyperparameter configurations
- ✅ **Import Resolution**: No more ModuleNotFoundError exceptions - all relative imports working correctly
- ✅ **Dependency Management**: Ray, yfinance, pandas-ta, and all other dependencies loaded successfully
- ✅ **HPO Infrastructure**: Ray Tune distributed workers spawning and executing properly

❌ **Critical Data Pipeline Issue Confirmed**: All 5 trials still failing with "No training data provided" errors:
- **Trial Execution Times**: ~0.002s each (extremely fast failure indicating immediate data loading failure)
- **Error Location**: `TrainingEngine._load_data()` at line 265 raises `ValueError: No training data provided`
- **All Trials Results**: `loss: inf` and error "...ing data provided"
- **HPO Results Location**: `/home/alessio/Personal/ReinforceStrategyCreatorV2/reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/hpo_results/dqn/dqn_hpo_quick_test`

🔍 **Root Cause Analysis Required**: The issue is NOT in the HPO infrastructure or import paths, but in the data pipeline:
- YFinanceDataSource works correctly when tested directly with `PYTHONPATH=.` (returns 250 rows of SPY data)
- The failure occurs specifically within Ray Tune worker processes during data loading
- This suggests a configuration or environment issue in how the data pipeline is called within the HPO context
- Need to investigate the data configuration passed to Ray workers and DataManager.load_data() integration

**Next Steps**: Investigate the data pipeline configuration within the HPO context to understand why YFinanceDataSource fails in Ray workers despite working correctly in direct testing.

**2025-06-07 17:16:30** - ✅ HPO TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!
