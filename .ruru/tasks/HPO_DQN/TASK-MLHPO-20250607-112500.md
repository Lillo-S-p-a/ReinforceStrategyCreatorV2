# Run Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) for DQN Model

## Description ✍️

*   **What is this feature?** This task involves executing the Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) process for the DQN model to identify an optimal set of hyperparameters.
*   **Why is it needed?** The current DQN model, while functional, is not yet performing well. HPO is a critical step to improve its learning capability and overall trading strategy performance.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Configure and run an HPO experiment for the DQN model using the existing `HPOptimizer` and relevant configurations.
    *   Analyze the HPO results to determine the best hyperparameter set.
    *   The actual retraining of the model with these new hyperparameters will be a subsequent task.
*   **Links:**
    *   HPO Configuration: [`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/configs/base/hpo.yaml`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/configs/base/hpo.yaml)
    *   HPO Logic: [`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/training/hpo_optimizer.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/training/hpo_optimizer.py)
    *   Example HPO script: [`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/examples/hpo_example.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/examples/hpo_example.py)
    *   DQN Model: [`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/models/implementations/dqn.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/models/implementations/dqn.py)

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

*   - [ ] An HPO experiment for the DQN model is successfully configured and executed.
*   - [ ] The HPO experiment uses an appropriate preset (e.g., "quick_test" for initial validation, then potentially "standard" from [`hpo.yaml`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/configs/base/hpo.yaml:1)).
*   - [ ] The HPO process utilizes actual project data as defined in the main pipeline configurations (e.g., from [`pipeline.yaml`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/configs/base/pipeline.yaml)), not just sample data.
*   - [ ] The results of the HPO run (e.g., path to the `..._results.json` file) are saved and reported.
*   - [ ] The best set of hyperparameters for the DQN model, as determined by the HPO process, is clearly identified and reported.
*   - [ ] A brief summary of the HPO run (e.g., number of trials, best score) is provided.

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks 📝

*   - [ ] **Setup HPO Script:**
    *   Adapt the existing [`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/examples/hpo_example.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/examples/hpo_example.py:1) or create a new script specifically for running HPO on the DQN model.
    *   This script should correctly initialize `ConfigLoader`, `DataManager`, `TrainingEngine`, and `HPOptimizer`.
*   - [ ] **Configure Data Source:**
    *   Ensure the `data_config` for the HPO run correctly references the project's actual data sources (e.g., by loading configurations from [`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/configs/base/pipeline.yaml`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/configs/base/pipeline.yaml) and extracting the relevant data source ID and parameters for the `DataManager`).
    *   The HPO process should train on the same data features as the main pipeline.
*   - [ ] **Configure HPO Experiment:**
    *   Set the `model_config` to target the "dqn" model type.
    *   Use the "dqn" `search_spaces` and `param_mappings` from [`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/configs/base/hpo.yaml`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/configs/base/hpo.yaml:1).
    *   Select an appropriate HPO experiment preset (e.g., `quick_test` initially, then potentially `standard`). Specify `num_trials`, `search_algorithm`, `scheduler`, `metric` (e.g., "val_loss"), and `mode` (e.g., "min").
*   - [ ] **Execute HPO Run:**
    *   Run the configured HPO script.
    *   Monitor the execution for any errors.
*   - [ ] **Collect and Report Results:**
    *   Once the HPO run is complete, identify the path to the generated results JSON file (e.g., in `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/hpo_results/`).
    *   Report this path.
    *   Use `hpo_optimizer.analyze_results()` or manually inspect the results file to identify and report the `best_params` and `best_score`.

**2025-06-07 14:16:32** - HPO Script Execution Completed with Critical Issue
- ✅ Successfully executed HPO script with all dependency fixes applied
- ✅ Ray Tune infrastructure initialized correctly (5 trials, quick_test preset)
- ✅ Model factory registration working in distributed workers
- ✅ All import path issues resolved (scipy, sklearn, yfinance dependencies)
- ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED**: All 5 trials failed with "No training data provided" error
- 📊 HPO Results Location: `/home/alessio/Personal/ReinforceStrategyCreatorV2/reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/hpo_results/dqn/dqn_hpo_quick_test`
- 🔍 Root Cause: Data loading pipeline in TrainingEngine._load_data() method failing
- 📋 Error Details: `ValueError: No training data provided` in engine.py line 265
- 🚫 Task Status: Changed to "⚪ Blocked" - requires data pipeline investigation before HPO can proceed

**Technical Analysis:**
- HPO infrastructure is fully functional and ready
- All previous import/dependency issues have been resolved
- The blocking issue is in the data preparation/loading phase
- Need to investigate DataManager.load_data() and TrainingEngine._load_data() integration
- This is a separate data pipeline issue, not an HPO-specific problem
