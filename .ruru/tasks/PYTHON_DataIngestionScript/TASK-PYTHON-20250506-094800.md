# Develop Data Ingestion Script for TimescaleDB Market Data

## 1. Description

With the new TimescaleDB container (`timescaledb_market_data` service) and `market_data` schema in place (see `TASK-ARCH-20250506-094000`), this task is to create a robust Python script for populating this database with historical market data.

**Key Responsibilities:**
1.  **Data Fetching:**
    *   The script should be able to fetch historical OHLCV data for a list of specified ticker symbols and date ranges. Initially, use `yfinance` as the data source.
    *   Implement appropriate error handling for data fetching (e.g., ticker not found, API errors, rate limits).
    *   Be mindful of rate limits during the initial bulk load. Consider fetching data in chunks or with delays if necessary.
2.  **Indicator Calculation:**
    *   The script should calculate the technical indicators specified in the `market_data` schema (e.g., SMA(20), EMA(12), RSI(14), MACD components) using libraries like `pandas_ta` or `talib`.
    *   Ensure indicator calculations align with the columns defined in the `market_data` table.
3.  **Data Transformation:**
    *   Transform the fetched and calculated data into a format suitable for insertion into the `market_data` table (e.g., a list of tuples or a Pandas DataFrame that matches the table structure).
    *   Handle timezone conversions correctly to ensure data is stored as `TIMESTAMPTZ`.
4.  **Database Insertion:**
    *   Connect to the TimescaleDB instance using connection parameters from environment variables (as configured in `TASK-DEVOPS-20250506-094300`). Use `psycopg2` or `SQLAlchemy`.
    *   Implement efficient bulk insertion of data. For `psycopg2`, consider `copy_from` or `execute_values`. For `SQLAlchemy`, use its bulk insert methods.
    *   Handle potential data conflicts (e.g., if re-running for overlapping periods) using `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (ticker, timestamp) DO NOTHING` or `DO UPDATE SET ...` as appropriate. `DO NOTHING` is likely sufficient for initial load.
5.  **Script Configuration:**
    *   The script should be configurable (e.g., via command-line arguments or a configuration file) for:
        *   List of tickers.
        *   Start and end dates for historical data.
        *   Database connection parameters (though primarily sourced from env vars).
6.  **Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging for the script's operations (data fetched, records inserted, errors encountered).

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

*   A Python script (`ingest_market_data.py` or similar) is created.
*   The script can successfully fetch historical OHLCV data for specified tickers (e.g., 'SPY') and date ranges.
*   The script calculates the required technical indicators and includes them in the data to be inserted.
*   The script connects to the TimescaleDB and bulk-inserts the data into the `market_data` table.
*   Data integrity is maintained (correct data types, no duplicates for ticker/timestamp).
*   The script is configurable for tickers and date ranges.
*   The script includes robust error handling and logging.
*   The script is well-documented with comments.
*   The script is committed to the `feature/timeseries-db` branch.

## 3. Checklist

*   [ ] Design script structure and command-line arguments/config.
*   [ ] Implement data fetching logic using `yfinance`.
*   [ ] Implement technical indicator calculation using `pandas_ta` or similar.
*   [ ] Implement data transformation to match `market_data` schema.
*   [ ] Implement database connection logic (sourcing credentials from env).
*   [ ] Implement bulk data insertion logic with conflict handling.
*   [ ] Add error handling and logging throughout the script.
*   [ ] Test script with a small set of tickers and a limited date range.
*   [ ] Test script with a larger historical load (e.g., SPY for 5 years).
*   [ ] Verify data in TimescaleDB using `psql` or a DB tool.
*   [ ] Document script usage in comments or a README section.
*   [ ] Commit script and any supporting files to the `feature/timeseries-db` branch.
