# Task: Fix `model.fit` call in `rl_agent.py` learn method

## 📝 Description

The test `tests/test_rl_agent.py::TestStrategyAgentLearnLogic::test_learn_q_value_target_calculation_and_fit` fails with `AssertionError: Expected at least 3 positional args for fit (self, x, y)`. This indicates the `model.fit()` call within the `learn` method of `StrategyAgent` in `reinforcestrategycreator/rl_agent.py` is likely missing the target values (`y`) argument.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

*   The `test_learn_q_value_target_calculation_and_fit` test passes when run with `pytest tests/test_rl_agent.py`.

## 📋 Checklist

- [✅] Read `reinforcestrategycreator/rl_agent.py`.
- [✅] Locate the `learn` method within the `StrategyAgent` class.
- [✅] Identify the `self.model.fit(...)` call.
- [✅] Ensure the call includes the `target_q_values` (or equivalent calculated target) as the `y` argument. (Confirmed in `rl_agent.py`)
- [✅] Verify the `target_q_values` are correctly calculated and have the appropriate shape before the `fit` call. (Confirmed in `rl_agent.py`)
- [✅] Run `pytest tests/test_rl_agent.py::TestStrategyAgentLearnLogic::test_learn_q_value_target_calculation_and_fit` to confirm the fix.
- [✅] Update this MDTM task status to `🟢 Done`.

## 🪵 Logs / Notes

*   2025-04-30 00:50: The `learn` method in `rl_agent.py` correctly calls `model.fit` with `states` (x) and `target_q_values` (y).
*   The initial test failure `AssertionError: Expected at least 3 positional args for fit (self, x, y)` originated from the test `tests/test_rl_agent.py::TestStrategyAgentLearnLogic::test_learn_q_value_target_calculation_and_fit`.
*   The test incorrectly assumed the mocked `tf.keras.Model.fit` would receive `self` as the first positional argument. Corrected assertion.
*   Subsequent failures were due to mismatches in comparing calculated target Q-values (`expected_targets`) with the values passed to the mocked `fit` (`fit_targets`), caused by the shuffling from `random.sample`.
*   2025-04-30 01:00: Refactored the test to mock `random.sample`, control the minibatch, and calculate expected targets based on the controlled shuffled data. This resolved the assertion errors. Test now passes.
