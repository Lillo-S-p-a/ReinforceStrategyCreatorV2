## üìù Description

Following the successful fix of the Datadog dashboard import issues (Task [`TASK-DEVPY-20250602-154200-FixDashboardTableWidgetError.md`](.ruru/tasks/DEVPY/TASK-DEVPY-20250602-154200-FixDashboardTableWidgetError.md)), the user wants to run the main pipeline to verify that data is being correctly sent to and visualized in Datadog.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

1.  The `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/run_main_pipeline.py` script is executed successfully.
2.  Evidence (e.g., script logs, Datadog UI observation) confirms that relevant metrics and/or logs from the pipeline run are appearing in Datadog.
3.  The newly fixed `drift_detection_dashboard.json` (or other relevant dashboards) shows updated data if the pipeline run generates data for it.

## üìã Checklist

- [‚úÖ] Execute the main pipeline script: `python reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/run_main_pipeline.py`.
- [‚úÖ] Monitor the script's output for any errors, particularly those related to Datadog communication or metric submission.
- [ ] After the script completes (or during its execution if it sends data incrementally), verify in the Datadog UI that new data related to this pipeline run is visible. This may involve checking the `drift_detection_dashboard` or other relevant metric explorers. (Manual step)
- [ ] Report the outcome of the pipeline execution and Datadog data verification.

## ü™µ Log / Notes

- 2025-06-02 17:12: Executed `python reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/run_main_pipeline.py`. Script completed with exit code 0. Logs show metrics and events being prepared for Datadog. Datadog client configured with prefix `model_pipeline`.
- An error was logged during the Deployment stage: "No data available for paper trading". This is not directly related to Datadog metric/event submission from other stages.
- Verification of data in Datadog UI is a manual step.
- This task is to confirm end-to-end data flow to Datadog after recent fixes.
