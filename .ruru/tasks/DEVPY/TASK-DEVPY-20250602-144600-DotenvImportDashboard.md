## üìù Description

The `import_datadog_dashboard.py` script currently fails because it cannot find the `DATADOG_API_KEY` and `DATADOG_APP_KEY` environment variables. These variables have been added to the `.env` file, but the script does not explicitly load this file.

The `python-dotenv` package is already a project dependency. This task is to modify `import_datadog_dashboard.py` to use `python-dotenv` to load variables from the `.env` file at the beginning of the script.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

1.  `import_datadog_dashboard.py` is modified to include `from dotenv import load_dotenv` and `load_dotenv()` at the beginning of its execution flow.
2.  After modification, the script successfully loads environment variables from the `.env` file.
3.  When the script is run (assuming correct API keys in `.env`), it no longer errors out due to missing API keys. (It may still fail if keys are invalid or other Datadog issues occur, but the key loading part should work).

## üìã Checklist

- [‚úÖ] Add `from dotenv import load_dotenv` to the imports in `import_datadog_dashboard.py`.
- [‚úÖ] Add `load_dotenv()` call near the beginning of the script's execution, before `os.environ.get()` is used for Datadog keys.
- [‚úÖ] Test running the script (e.g., `python import_datadog_dashboard.py reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/monitoring/datadog_dashboards/drift_detection_dashboard.json`) to ensure it no longer reports missing API keys (assuming `.env` is populated).

## ü™µ Log / Notes

- This task is to fix the environment variable loading mechanism for the dashboard import script.
