## Description

The `DeploymentStage` for paper trading has been implemented and E2E tested as part of task [TASK-DEVPY-20250601-231230](.ruru/tasks/DEVPY/TASK-DEVPY-20250601-231230-ImplementDeploymentStage.md). The final remaining item for that feature is to write comprehensive unit tests for the new `DeploymentStage` class located at [`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/pipeline/stages/deployment.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/pipeline/stages/deployment.py).

This task is to create these unit tests, ensuring good coverage of the stage's logic, including its `setup`, `run`, and `teardown` methods, and interactions with context objects (ConfigManager, ArtifactStore, ModelRegistry, DataManager, MonitoringService).

## Acceptance Criteria

-   Unit tests are created for the `DeploymentStage` class.
-   Tests cover different scenarios, including:
    -   Correct initialization and setup based on pipeline context and configuration.
    -   Successful loading of the trained model.
    -   Correct simulation of paper trading logic (buy/sell/hold decisions based on mock model output).
    -   Proper handling of virtual portfolio updates.
    -   Verification of logged messages for simulated trades and portfolio status.
    -   Graceful handling of missing or invalid configurations or context elements.
    -   Correct interaction with the `MonitoringService` for logging metrics and events.
-   Tests are placed in the appropriate test directory (e.g., `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/tests/unit/pipeline/stages/test_deployment_stage.py`).
-   All new unit tests pass successfully.
-   Code coverage for the `DeploymentStage` is reasonably high.

## Checklist

-   `[âœ…]` Analyze `DeploymentStage` in [`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/pipeline/stages/deployment.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/pipeline/stages/deployment.py) to identify key functionalities and edge cases for testing.
-   `[âœ…]` Create a new test file (e.g., `test_deployment_stage.py`) in the unit test directory.
-   `[ ]` Write unit tests for the `setup()` method:
    -   `[ ]` Test successful setup with valid context and configuration.
    -   `[ ]` Test handling of missing `ConfigManager`, `ArtifactStore`, `ModelRegistry`, `DataManager`, `MonitoringService` in context (if applicable, or ensure errors are raised).
    -   `[ ]` Test loading of deployment configuration.
    -   `[ ]` Test retrieval of model artifact ID from context.
-   `[ ]` Write unit tests for the `run()` method:
    -   `[ ]` Mock dependencies (model loading, data fetching if applicable, monitoring service).
    -   `[ ]` Test paper trading logic with mock model signals (buy, sell, hold).
    -   `[ ]` Verify virtual portfolio updates correctly.
    -   `[ ]` Verify correct logging of simulated trades and portfolio status.
    -   `[ ]` Test handling of `paper_trading` mode specifically.
    -   `[ ]` Test graceful handling of live trading parameters if present in `paper_trading` mode.
    -   `[ ]` Verify calls to `monitoring_service.log_metric` and `monitoring_service.log_event` with expected parameters.
-   `[ ]` Write unit tests for the `teardown()` method (if it has any logic).
-   `[ ]` Ensure all tests pass.
-   `[ ]` (Optional) Check code coverage for the `DeploymentStage`.

## Notes
- Utilize mocking libraries (e.g., `unittest.mock.patch`) extensively to isolate the `DeploymentStage` from its dependencies during testing.
- Focus on testing the logic within the `DeploymentStage` itself, not the full pipeline execution.
