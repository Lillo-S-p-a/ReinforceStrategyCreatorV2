## üìù Description

Following fixes implemented in Task [`TASK-DEVPY-20250602-174100-InvestigateEmptyDatadogDashboard.md`](.ruru/tasks/DEVPY/TASK-DEVPY-20250602-174100-InvestigateEmptyDatadogDashboard.md) to enable `model_pipeline.drift_check` service check submissions, this task is to re-run the main pipeline and verify that these service checks, and potentially other metrics, now appear correctly on the Datadog dashboard ([`drift_detection_dashboard.json`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/monitoring/datadog_dashboards/drift_detection_dashboard.json)).

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

1.  The `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/run_main_pipeline.py` script is executed successfully.
2.  Evidence (e.g., script logs, Datadog UI observation) confirms that `model_pipeline.drift_check` service checks are being submitted.
3.  The "Features with Active Drift" widget on the `drift_detection_dashboard.json` populates with data.
4.  Other relevant metrics on the dashboard also show data from the pipeline run.

## üìã Checklist

- [ ] Execute the main pipeline script: `python reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/run_main_pipeline.py`.
- [ ] Monitor the script's output for any errors, particularly those related to Datadog communication, metric submission, or service check submission.
- [ ] After the script completes, verify in the Datadog UI that new data related to this pipeline run is visible, especially in the "Features with Active Drift" widget.
- [ ] Report the outcome of the pipeline execution and Datadog data verification, including a screenshot if possible.

## ü™µ Log / Notes

- This task is to confirm the efficacy of the service check submission fixes.
- 2025-06-02 18:13: Pipeline executed. User confirmed Datadog UI shows "Features with Active Drift" widget is empty and `model_pipeline.drift_check` service checks are NOT present. Underlying issue with service check submission or configuration persists. Task verification failed.
