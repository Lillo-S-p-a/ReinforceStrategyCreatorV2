# Write Detailed Documentation for ReinforceStrategyCreator Pipeline

## Description ✍️

*   **What needs to be documented?** The `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline`. This task involves writing the full textual content based on the outline provided by the `core-architect` (see `related_docs`).
*   **Why is it needed?** To provide clear, comprehensive documentation for data scientists, quant analysts, and ML engineers.
*   **Target Audience:** Data Scientists, Quant Analysts, ML Engineers.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Write detailed explanations for each section outlined in `TASK-ARCH-20250531-013000.md`.
    *   Ensure clarity, accuracy, and completeness of the information.
    *   Maintain a consistent tone and style suitable for the target audience.
    *   The primary output should be a new Markdown file, proposed path: `.ruru/docs/pipeline/reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline_v1.md`. Confirm or suggest an alternative if more appropriate.
    *   Placeholder sections should be included where Mermaid diagrams (to be created by `design-diagramer` in a parallel task `TASK-DIAG-20250531-013400`) are indicated in the outline. Use a clear placeholder like `[Mermaid Diagram: [Diagram Description] - To be inserted]`

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

*   - [✅] All sections from the architect's outline (`TASK-ARCH-20250531-013000.md`) are covered with detailed textual content.
*   - [✅] The documentation is written clearly and is understandable by the target audience.
*   - [✅] Technical accuracy is maintained throughout the document.
*   - [✅] Placeholders for all specified Mermaid diagrams are correctly inserted.
*   - [✅] The final documentation is saved to an agreed-upon Markdown file (e.g., `.ruru/docs/pipeline/reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline_v1.md`).
*   - [✅] The content is well-structured and follows the provided outline.

## Implementation Notes / Content Outline 📝

*   Refer to the "Implementation Notes / Content Outline" section within `.ruru/tasks/DOC_PipelineAnalysis/TASK-ARCH-20250531-013000.md` for the detailed structure to follow.
*   Focus on elaborating each point in the outline with sufficient detail.
*   Collaborate with the `design-diagramer` (working on `TASK-DIAG-20250531-013400`) if clarification on diagram placement or content is needed, though the primary specification for diagrams comes from the architect's outline.
