# Create System Setup Document (docs/setup.md)

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

*   **What needs to be documented?** The `docs/setup.md` file for the ReinforceStrategyCreatorV2 system.
*   **Why is it needed?** To provide detailed instructions for setting up development, testing/staging, and production environments.
*   **Target Audience:** Technical teams (developers, operations).
*   **Scope:** The document must cover:
    *   Detailed instructions for setting up development environment.
    *   Detailed instructions for setting up testing/staging environment (if applicable, or note if same as dev).
    *   Detailed instructions for setting up production environment (if applicable, or note if different).
    *   Prerequisites (OS, software versions like Python, Docker, etc.).
    *   Dependencies (how to install, e.g., `poetry install`).
    *   Configuration management (e.g., use of `.env` files).
    *   Environment variables: list all, explain their purpose, and provide example values.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [‚úÖ] `docs/setup.md` is created.
*   - [‚úÖ] Provides clear, step-by-step instructions for development environment setup.
*   - [‚úÖ] Describes setup for testing/staging environments or clarifies if they align with development.
*   - [‚úÖ] Describes setup for production environment or clarifies differences.
*   - [‚úÖ] Lists all necessary prerequisites.
*   - [‚úÖ] Explains how to install project dependencies (e.g., using `poetry`).
*   - [‚úÖ] Details configuration management (e.g., `.env` file usage).
*   - [‚úÖ] Lists all environment variables from `.env` (or `.env.example`), explains their purpose, and gives example values.
*   - [‚úÖ] Document is written in clear, concise, and technically accurate Markdown.
*   - [‚úÖ] No placeholder text remains.

## Implementation Notes / Content Outline üìù

*   `docs/setup.md`
    *   Section: Prerequisites
        *   Operating System recommendations
        *   Python version (from `pyproject.toml`)
        *   Poetry (installation link)
        *   Docker & Docker Compose (if `docker-compose.yml` is used for services like DB)
        *   Other tools (Git)
    *   Section: Development Environment Setup
        *   Cloning the repository
        *   Installing dependencies (`poetry install`)
        *   Setting up the `.env` file (copy from `.env.example` if it exists, or list variables)
        *   Database initialization (`init_db.py` or similar)
        *   Running the application/tests
    *   Section: Testing/Staging Environment Setup
        *   (Describe if different from dev, otherwise state similarity)
    *   Section: Production Environment Setup
        *   (Describe if different, focus on deployment aspects like service management, .env for production)
    *   Section: Configuration Management
        *   Explanation of `.env` file usage.
    *   Section: Environment Variables
        *   Table: Variable Name | Purpose | Example Value
        *   (Extract from `.env` or code analysis if not explicitly listed)

## AI Prompt Log ü§ñ (Optional)

*   Created the setup document by analyzing key configuration files including `pyproject.toml`, `.env`, `docker-compose.yml`, `init_db.py`, and training scripts.
*   Organized the document according to the requested structure with sections for prerequisites, development setup, testing/staging, production, and configuration management.
*   Added a comprehensive environment variables table with explanations for each variable.
*   Added a troubleshooting section to help users resolve common issues.

## Review Notes üëÄ (For Reviewer)

*   The document provides clear instructions for setting up all environments and includes all required configuration details.
