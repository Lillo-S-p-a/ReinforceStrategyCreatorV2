# Create System Operations & Maintenance Document (docs/operations.md)

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

*   **What needs to be documented?** The `docs/operations.md` file for the ReinforceStrategyCreatorV2 system.
*   **Why is it needed?** To provide guidance on monitoring, maintaining, and troubleshooting the system.
*   **Target Audience:** Technical teams (operations, developers, support).
*   **Scope:** The document must cover:
    *   Monitoring tools and key metrics to observe.
    *   Logging strategy (log locations, levels, rotation, analysis tools/methods).
    *   Backup and recovery procedures (for database, models, configurations).
    *   Common troubleshooting steps and solutions for known issues.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [‚úÖ] `docs/operations.md` is created.
*   - [‚úÖ] Describes monitoring tools (e.g., dashboard, custom scripts) and key metrics (e.g., training progress, API health, resource usage).
*   - [‚úÖ] Details the logging strategy: where logs are stored (e.g., `training_log.csv`, `replay_buffer_debug.log`, application logs), log levels, and how to analyze them.
*   - [‚úÖ] Outlines backup procedures for critical data (database, trained models in `production_models/`, configurations).
*   - [‚úÖ] Outlines recovery procedures from backups.
*   - [‚úÖ] Lists common troubleshooting steps for known or anticipated issues.
*   - [‚úÖ] Document is written in clear, concise, and technically accurate Markdown.
*   - [‚úÖ] No placeholder text remains.

## Implementation Notes / Content Outline üìù

*   `docs/operations.md`
    *   Section: Monitoring
        *   Tools: (e.g., `dashboard/main.py`, `run_dashboard.py`, any OS-level monitoring)
        *   Key Metrics:
            *   Training: Episode rewards, loss values, step counts (from `training_log.csv` or dashboard).
            *   System: CPU/memory usage, disk space.
            *   API: Request/response times, error rates (if API is a major component).
    *   Section: Logging
        *   Strategy Overview
        *   Log Files and Locations:
            *   `training_log.csv`: Purpose, format.
            *   `replay_buffer_debug.log`: Purpose, format.
            *   Application Logs (FastAPI, Dashboard): Location, levels.
            *   Docker Logs (if applicable).
        *   Log Analysis: (Tools or methods, e.g., `analyze_latest_run.py`, `check_episodes.py`)
    *   Section: Backup and Recovery
        *   Database Backup: (e.g., `sqlite3 .backup`, or if using Docker, volume backup strategy)
        *   Trained Models Backup: (Strategy for `models/` and `production_models/`)
        *   Configuration Backup: (`.env`, `pyproject.toml`, `docker-compose.yml`)
        *   Recovery Procedures: (Steps to restore from each type of backup)
    *   Section: Common Troubleshooting
        *   Issue: Training not starting / errors during training.
            *   Solution: Check dependencies, `.env` variables, data availability, resource limits.
        *   Issue: Dashboard not loading / errors.
            *   Solution: Check API logs, dashboard logs, network connectivity.
        *   Issue: Database connection problems.
            *   Solution: Check `docker-compose.yml` if DB is containerized, check `.env` for DB_URL.
        *   Issue: Model loading errors.
            *   Solution: Verify model file paths, compatibility.
