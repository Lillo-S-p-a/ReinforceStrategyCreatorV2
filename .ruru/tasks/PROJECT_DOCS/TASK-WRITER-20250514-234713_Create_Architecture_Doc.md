# Create System Architecture Document (docs/architecture.md)

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

*   **What needs to be documented?** The `docs/architecture.md` file for the ReinforceStrategyCreatorV2 system.
*   **Why is it needed?** To provide a detailed understanding of the system's architecture, components, interactions, technology stack, data models, and integrations.
*   **Target Audience:** Technical teams (developers, architects, operations).
*   **Scope:** The document must cover:
    *   High-level architectural diagram (Mermaid or image in `docs/assets/images/`).
    *   Detailed breakdown of components/modules, their responsibilities, and interactions (using Mermaid sequence or component diagrams).
    *   Technology stack (languages, frameworks, databases, services).
    *   Data models and data flow diagrams (Mermaid ERD or flowcharts).
    *   External system integrations and dependencies.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [‚úÖ] `docs/architecture.md` is created.
*   - [‚úÖ] Includes a high-level architectural diagram (Mermaid or linked image).
*   - [‚úÖ] Details components/modules with responsibilities and interactions (Mermaid diagrams).
*   - [‚úÖ] Lists the complete technology stack.
*   - [‚úÖ] Describes data models and data flow (Mermaid diagrams).
*   - [‚úÖ] Identifies external system integrations and dependencies.
*   - [‚úÖ] All diagrams are correctly rendered and clearly explained.
*   - [‚úÖ] Document is written in clear, concise, and technically accurate Markdown.
*   - [‚úÖ] No placeholder text remains.

## Implementation Notes / Content Outline üìù

*   `docs/architecture.md`
    *   Section: High-Level Architecture
        *   Diagram (Mermaid: C4 Context/Container, or general component diagram)
        *   Explanation
    *   Section: Components and Modules
        *   For each major component (e.g., `data_fetcher`, `rl_agent`, `trading_environment`, `api`, `dashboard`):
            *   Responsibilities
            *   Key interactions (Mermaid sequence diagram if complex)
    *   Section: Technology Stack
        *   Languages (Python)
        *   Frameworks (FastAPI, Stable-Baselines3, Pandas, etc.)
        *   Databases (SQLite, potentially others)
        *   Key Libraries/Services
    *   Section: Data Models and Data Flow
        *   Database Schema (Mermaid ERD for `db_models.py`)
        *   Data Flow Diagram (Mermaid flowchart for main processes, e.g., training loop, data ingestion)
    *   Section: External System Integrations
        *   (e.g., Data providers, broker APIs - if any)
    *   Section: Dependencies
        *   (Key external libraries from `pyproject.toml`)

## AI Prompt Log ü§ñ (Optional)

*   Created comprehensive architecture documentation by analyzing project codebase, especially the core modules in the `reinforcestrategycreator/` directory
*   Generated multiple Mermaid diagrams (system overview, component interactions, database ERD, data flow)
*   Documented all main components: DataFetcher, TechnicalAnalyzer, TradingEnvironment, RL Agent, API, and Dashboard
*   Detailed the technology stack and dependencies from `pyproject.toml`
