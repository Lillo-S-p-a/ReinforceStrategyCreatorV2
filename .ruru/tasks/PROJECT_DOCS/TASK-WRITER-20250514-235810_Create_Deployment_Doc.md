# Create System Deployment Document (docs/deployment.md)

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

*   **What needs to be documented?** The `docs/deployment.md` file for the ReinforceStrategyCreatorV2 system.
*   **Why is it needed?** To provide detailed instructions for deploying the system to various environments.
*   **Target Audience:** Technical teams (developers, operations, DevOps).
*   **Scope:** The document must cover:
    *   Step-by-step deployment process for each environment (development, testing/staging, production).
    *   CI/CD pipeline overview (if applicable, tools used, stages, triggers).
    *   Rollback procedures for each environment.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   - [‚úÖ] `docs/deployment.md` is created.
*   - [‚úÖ] Provides clear, step-by-step deployment instructions for development environment.
*   - [‚úÖ] Provides clear, step-by-step deployment instructions for testing/staging environment.
*   - [‚úÖ] Provides clear, step-by-step deployment instructions for production environment.
*   - [‚úÖ] Describes the CI/CD pipeline if one exists (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI) or states if manual.
*   - [‚úÖ] Details rollback procedures for failed deployments in each environment.
*   - [‚úÖ] Document is written in clear, concise, and technically accurate Markdown.
*   - [‚úÖ] No placeholder text remains.

## Implementation Notes / Content Outline üìù

*   `docs/deployment.md`
    *   Section: Deployment Overview
        *   General strategy (e.g., Docker containers, serverless, manual scripts).
    *   Section: Development Environment Deployment
        *   (Likely covered by setup, but reiterate key run commands e.g., `run_debug_train.sh`, `run_dashboard.py`)
    *   Section: Testing/Staging Environment Deployment
        *   (Detail steps if different from dev; e.g., building Docker images, deploying to a specific server/service)
    *   Section: Production Environment Deployment
        *   (Detailed steps for production, including any specific configurations, service management, e.g., using `docker-compose.yml` in production mode)
        *   Consider how `production_models/` are managed and deployed.
    *   Section: CI/CD Pipeline (If Applicable)
        *   Tools used (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
        *   Pipeline stages (build, test, deploy).
        *   Triggers (e.g., push to main branch).
        *   (If no CI/CD, state that deployment is manual and describe the process).
    *   Section: Rollback Procedures
        *   For Development (e.g., `git checkout <previous_commit>`)
        *   For Testing/Staging (e.g., redeploy previous Docker image version)
        *   For Production (critical: detail steps to revert to a stable state)

## AI Prompt Log ü§ñ (Optional)

*   Analyzed `docker-compose.yml` to understand database deployment configuration
*   Examined shell scripts (`run_train.sh`, `run_debug_train.sh`) to document training deployment process
*   Referenced `README.md`, `setup.md`, and `architecture.md` to ensure deployment documentation aligned with existing system documentation
*   Created comprehensive deployment instructions covering all required environments
*   Documented manual deployment processes as no automated CI/CD pipeline was detected
*   Included detailed rollback procedures for each environment
