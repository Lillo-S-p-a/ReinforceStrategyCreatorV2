# Database Configuration and Connection Issue

## Description

We're experiencing persistent authentication issues when trying to connect to a TimescaleDB container from our application. Despite setting environment variables correctly and recreating the container, we continue to get the error: "password authentication failed for user 'postgres'".

## Current Setup

- **Docker Container**: TimescaleDB running on port 5433
- **Environment Variables** in `.env`:
  ```
  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:mysecretpassword@localhost:5433/trading_db
  POSTGRES_USER=postgres
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword
  POSTGRES_DB=trading_db
  ```
- **Docker Compose Configuration**:
  ```yaml
  services:
    timescaledb:
      image: timescale/timescaledb:latest-pg16
      container_name: timescaledb_market_data
      environment:
        POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER:-user}
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-password}
        POSTGRES_DB: ${POSTGRES_DB:-marketdata}
      ports:
        - "5433:5432"
      volumes:
        - timescaledb_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  ```

## Steps Tried

1. Updated `.env` file variables from `TIMESCALEDB_*` to `POSTGRES_*`
2. Used `docker compose down -v` to remove the container and its volumes
3. Recreated the container with `docker compose up -d timescaledb`
4. Waited for initialization before running `init_db.py`

## Error Message

```
Error connecting to the database: (psycopg2.OperationalError) connection to server at "localhost" (127.0.0.1), port 5433 failed: FATAL: password authentication failed for user "postgres"
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [‚úÖ] Identify the root cause of the authentication issue
- [‚úÖ] Modify the configuration as needed to resolve the authentication problem
- [‚úÖ] Successfully run `init_db.py` to initialize the database schema
- [‚úÖ] Document the solution for future reference

## Resources

- The database connection is established in `reinforcestrategycreator/db_utils.py`
- The database initialization script is `init_db.py`
- Docker Compose configuration is in `docker-compose.yml`
- Environment variables are in `.env`

## Notes

It's possible that there's a mismatch between how the environment variables are being used in Docker Compose vs. how they're being referenced in the application code. Alternatively, there might be an issue with how PostgreSQL is configured inside the container.

## Solution Implemented

We identified that we needed two separate database services:

1. TimescaleDB for the `marketdata` database (time-series data)
2. Regular PostgreSQL for the `trading_db` database (application data)

### Changes Made:

1. Modified `docker-compose.yml` to include both services:
   - TimescaleDB service on port 5433
   - PostgreSQL service on port 5434 (originally tried 5432 but was already in use)

2. Updated `.env` file to include credentials for both databases:
   ```
   # TimescaleDB (marketdata) credentials
   TIMESCALEDB_USER=user
   TIMESCALEDB_PASSWORD=password
   TIMESCALEDB_DB=marketdata

   # PostgreSQL (trading_db) credentials
   POSTGRES_USER=postgres
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword
   POSTGRES_DB=trading_db
   ```

3. Updated `DATABASE_URL` to use port 5434:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:mysecretpassword@localhost:5434/trading_db
   ```

4. Ran `docker compose down -v` to remove existing containers and volumes

5. Started services with `docker compose up -d`

6. Successfully ran `init_db.py` to initialize the schema in the trading_db database

Both databases are now running and accessible via their respective ports.
