# Implement Task 2.1: Pipeline Orchestrator Core

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

*   **What is this feature?**
    This task is to implement **Task 2.1: Pipeline Orchestrator Core** as defined in the Model Pipeline Implementation Plan ([`.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md`](.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md:108)).
    The objective is to implement the main pipeline orchestration engine for the `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline` project.
*   **Why is it needed?**
    A robust orchestration engine is required to manage the execution of pipeline stages, handle dependencies, and manage shared state.
*   **Scope (from Implementation Plan - Task 2.1):**
    *   Implement the `ModelPipeline` main class.
    *   Implement the `PipelineStage` abstract base class.
    *   Implement `PipelineContext` for shared state management.
    *   Implement `PipelineExecutor` for executing pipeline stages.
*   **Links:**
    *   Implementation Plan: [`.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md#task-21-pipeline-orchestrator-core`](.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md#task-21-pipeline-orchestrator-core)
    *   Architecture Document: (Refer to relevant sections on pipeline orchestration)

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

(Derived from Implementation Plan - Task 2.1 Deliverables)
*   - [‚úÖ] The `ModelPipeline` main class is implemented (e.g., in `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/pipeline/orchestrator.py` or `main.py`).
*   - [‚úÖ] The `PipelineStage` abstract base class is defined (e.g., in `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/pipeline/stage.py`).
*   - [‚úÖ] The `PipelineContext` class for managing shared state between stages is implemented (e.g., in `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/pipeline/context.py`).
*   - [‚úÖ] The `PipelineExecutor` class responsible for executing stages, managing dependencies, and handling errors is implemented (e.g., in `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/pipeline/executor.py`).
*   - [ ] The orchestrator supports defining a sequence of stages and their dependencies.
*   - [ ] Basic error handling and recovery mechanisms are in place for stage execution.
*   - [ ] Pipeline state (e.g., current stage, context) can be persisted or tracked.
*   - [ ] Progress tracking and reporting capabilities are available.
*   - [‚úÖ] Unit tests are provided for the core orchestrator components.

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks üìù

*   Design the `ModelPipeline` class to load a pipeline definition (e.g., from configuration).
*   Define the `PipelineStage` interface (e.g., `setup()`, `run()`, `teardown()` methods).
*   Implement `PipelineContext` to allow stages to read and write shared data safely.
*   Develop `PipelineExecutor` to manage the lifecycle of stages, including dependency resolution (e.g., using a DAG).
*   Integrate with the logging system (Task 1.3) for detailed execution logs.
*   Integrate with the configuration management system (Task 1.2) for pipeline and stage configurations.
*   Consider how to handle stage-specific inputs and outputs.
