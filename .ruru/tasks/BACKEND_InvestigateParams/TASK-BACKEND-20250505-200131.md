# Investigate: Model Parameters Static Per Run vs. Dynamic Per Episode

## 📝 Description

The dashboard's "Model Analysis" section correctly displays model parameters fetched from the `/api/v1/episodes/{episode_id}/model/` endpoint. However, testing revealed that this endpoint returns the *exact same* set of parameters regardless of the `episode_id` requested within a single training run.

The user is unsure if this is the intended behavior (parameters are fixed for the entire run) or if parameters should potentially vary per episode (e.g., if certain agent state parameters were meant to be saved per episode).

## ❓ Investigation Goal

1.  Analyze the training script (`train.py` likely) to understand how and when model parameters are saved in relation to episodes and runs.
2.  Analyze the API endpoint logic (`reinforcestrategycreator/api/routers/episodes.py` likely) and any related database interactions (`reinforcestrategycreator/db_models.py`, `reinforcestrategycreator/db_utils.py` likely) to understand how parameters are retrieved for a given episode.
3.  Determine if the current behavior (static parameters per run returned for episode-specific requests) aligns with the intended design.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

1.  Clear determination of whether model parameters are *intended* to be static per run or dynamic per episode.
2.  Identification of the relevant code sections responsible for saving and retrieving these parameters.
3.  If the behavior is *not* intended, provide recommendations or identify the bug location for a subsequent fix task.
4.  If the behavior *is* intended, confirm this finding.

## 🚶 Checklist

- [✅] Review `train.py` parameter saving logic.
- [✅] Review API endpoint `/api/v1/episodes/{episode_id}/model/` in `reinforcestrategycreator/api/routers/episodes.py`.
- [✅] Review relevant database models/utility functions. (Implicitly reviewed via API logic accessing `Episode.training_run.parameters`)
- [✅] Determine intended vs. actual behavior.
- [✅] Document findings in the log.

## 🪵 Log

*   2025-05-05 20:01:31 - Task created by roo-commander following user query about static model parameters per episode.
*   2025-05-05 20:03:21 - Backend Lead: Investigation complete. API correctly returns static run-level config parameters per design. Behavior is intended.
*   2025-05-05 20:02:XX - **Investigation Findings:**
    *   `train.py` saves configuration hyperparameters (learning rate, gamma, etc.) once per run in the `TrainingRun.parameters` JSON field in the database.
    *   `train.py` saves the actual learned model *weights* to a separate file (e.g., `models/episode_X_model.keras`) at the end of *each* episode.
    *   The API endpoint `/api/v1/episodes/{episode_id}/model/` correctly retrieves the `Episode`, accesses its parent `TrainingRun`, and returns the static `parameters` field from the `TrainingRun`.
    *   **Conclusion:** The observed behavior (API returning the same parameters for different episodes in the same run) is **intended** for this specific endpoint, as it returns the run-level configuration hyperparameters, not the dynamic episode-specific model weights.
