# Create Database Verification Script for Parallel Training Validation

## üéØ Goal
Create a Python script to perform comprehensive database checks after a parallel training run. This script will verify that all tables are properly populated, all critical columns contain non-NULL values, and data consistency is maintained across tables.

## üìù Description
As part of our autonomous testing loop for the RLlib/Ray/PyTorch parallel training refactoring, we need to verify that all data is properly logged in the database after a training run. This task involves creating a script that can be executed to perform comprehensive database checks.

The script should:
1. Connect to the database using the existing connection utilities.
2. Verify that each target table (`episodes`, `steps`, `trades`, `trading_operations`, `training_run`) is populated (i.e., not empty).
3. Check all "critical columns" (defined in TASK-DB-20250515-154500) in all rows of these tables for NULL values.
4. Count the number of records in the `episodes` table.
5. Perform basic data consistency checks (e.g., ensure `episode_id` in `trades` and `steps` exists in the `episodes` table).
6. Log its findings clearly, indicating PASS or FAIL, and detailing any issues found (e.g., specific NULL values in table/column/row, incorrect episode count, consistency errors).

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- A Python script that can be executed to verify the database after a training run.
- The script checks that all tables are populated.
- The script checks that all critical columns contain non-NULL values.
- The script counts the number of records in the `episodes` table.
- The script performs basic data consistency checks.
- The script provides clear output indicating PASS or FAIL, and detailing any issues found.
- The script is executable from the command line without manual intervention.
- The script handles errors gracefully and provides meaningful error messages.
- The script uses the existing database connection utilities.

## üìã Checklist
- [ ] Review `reinforcestrategycreator/db_utils.py` to understand database connection utilities.
- [ ] Review `reinforcestrategycreator/db_models.py` to understand table relationships.
- [‚úÖ] Wait for the completion of TASK-DB-20250515-154500 to get the list of critical columns.
- [ ] Create a script to verify that all tables are populated.
- [ ] Implement checks for NULL values in critical columns.
- [ ] Implement a counter for the number of records in the `episodes` table.
- [ ] Implement basic data consistency checks.
- [ ] Implement clear output formatting (PASS/FAIL, detailed issues).
- [ ] Implement error handling and logging.
- [ ] Test the script to ensure it works as expected.
- [ ] Document the script usage.

## ü™µ Log / Notes
- 2025-05-15 15:48:00 (roo-commander): Task created and assigned to `lead-qa`.
- 2025-05-15 15:49:01 (roo-commander): The dependency on TASK-DB-20250515-154500 has been resolved. The list of critical columns is now available in that task. The QA team can proceed with implementing the verification script using these defined critical columns.
