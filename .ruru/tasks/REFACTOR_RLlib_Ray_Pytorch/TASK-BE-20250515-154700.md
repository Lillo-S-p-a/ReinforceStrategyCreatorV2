# Adapt Training Script for ~100 Episodes in Parallel Training

## üéØ Goal
Review and adapt the `train.py` script to aim for approximately 100 completed episodes in total across all parallel workers. This will involve adjusting the `NUM_TRAINING_ITERATIONS` parameter based on an estimate of how many episodes are typically completed per iteration.

## üìù Description
As part of our autonomous testing loop for the RLlib/Ray/PyTorch parallel training refactoring, we need to run training with approximately 100 completed episodes to ensure we have sufficient data for validation. The current `NUM_TRAINING_ITERATIONS` in `train.py` is set to 10, but we need to estimate how many iterations are needed to achieve approximately 100 episodes.

This task involves:
1. Analyzing the relationship between training iterations and completed episodes.
2. Adjusting the `NUM_TRAINING_ITERATIONS` parameter in `train.py` accordingly.
3. Ensuring the script is runnable without manual intervention.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- The `train.py` script is adapted to aim for approximately 100 completed episodes across all parallel workers.
- The script is runnable without manual intervention.
- The script provides clear output indicating progress and completion.
- The script handles errors gracefully and provides meaningful error messages.
- The script uses the existing RLlib/Ray/PyTorch setup.
