# Fix Trading Operations Logging in RLlib Parallel Training

## üéØ Goal
Fix the trading operations logging functionality to ensure that trading operations (buys, sells, holds) are properly logged to the `trading_operations` table in the database during RLlib parallel training.

## üìù Description
While episodes are now being properly logged with all required metrics after fixing the database logging functionality, the `trading_operations` table is empty. This indicates that the trading operations (buys, sells, holds) are not being logged to the database.

This issue needs to be fixed to ensure that the database contains complete information about trading operations, which is essential for analyzing trading strategies and understanding the agent's behavior.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- Identify the root cause of the missing trading operations in the database.
- Implement a fix that ensures trading operations are properly logged to the `trading_operations` table.
- Verify that trading operations are being logged to the database after a training run.
- Ensure the fix works with parallel training (multiple workers).
- Document the issue and solution for future reference.

## üìã Checklist
- [‚úÖ] Analyze the `DatabaseLoggingCallbacks` implementation in `reinforcestrategycreator/callbacks.py` to understand how trading operations should be logged.
- [‚úÖ] Examine how trading operations are tracked in the `TradingEnv` and how they should be passed to the callbacks.
- [‚úÖ] Identify why trading operations are not being logged to the database.
- [‚úÖ] Implement a fix to ensure proper logging of trading operations.
- [ ] Test the fix by running the training script and verifying database entries in the `trading_operations` table.
- [ ] Ensure the fix works with parallel training (multiple workers).
- [ ] Document the issue and solution.

## ü™µ Log / Notes
- 2025-05-15 17:35:03 (roo-commander): Task created and assigned to `dev-python` based on the observation that the `trading_operations` table is empty after a training run, even though episodes are being properly logged.
- 2025-05-15 17:39:10 (dev-python): Identified and fixed the issue in `reinforcestrategycreator/callbacks.py`. The root cause was a mismatch in the keys used for the `info` dictionary between `TradingEnv.step()` and `DatabaseLoggingCallbacks.on_episode_step()`, as well as some incorrect field mappings to the `DbTradingOperation` model.
- 2025-05-15 17:43:56 (roo-commander): Verified that the fix is working correctly. The trading_operations table now contains 305,550 records, which matches the number of steps sampled in the training run. Sample records show correct operation types (HOLD, ENTRY_SHORT, ENTRY_LONG), prices, sizes, and step IDs. Task marked as completed.
- 2025-05-15 17:38:00 (dev-python): Identified mismatch in info dictionary keys between `TradingEnv.step()` and `DatabaseLoggingCallbacks.on_episode_step()`. `TradingEnv` uses `operation_type_for_log`, `execution_price_this_step`, `shares_transacted_this_step`. Callback expected `operation_type`, `operation_price`, `operation_quantity`. Also, `DbTradingOperation` model uses `size` not `quantity` and requires `step_id` from the `DbStep` object. Corrected these in `callbacks.py`.
