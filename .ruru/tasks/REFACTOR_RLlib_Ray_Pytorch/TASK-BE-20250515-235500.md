# Fix Initial Portfolio Value Logging in RLlib Callbacks

## üéØ Goal
Fix the database logging callbacks to ensure that the `initial_portfolio_value` is properly set for all episodes during RLlib parallel training.

## üìù Description
During the autonomous testing and iteration loop (Phase 2) of the RLlib/Ray/PyTorch parallel training refactoring, we discovered that 63 out of 315 episodes had NULL values in the `initial_portfolio_value` column in the database. This issue was temporarily fixed by creating a script (`fix_null_initial_portfolio_values.py`) to update these NULL values to the default initial balance of 10000.0.

However, this is a workaround rather than a proper fix. The root cause needs to be addressed to ensure that the `initial_portfolio_value` is properly set for all episodes during training, without requiring a post-processing step.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- Identify the root cause of the NULL values in the `initial_portfolio_value` column.
- Implement a fix in the database logging callbacks to ensure that the `initial_portfolio_value` is properly set for all episodes.
- Verify that the fix works by running a training session and checking that all episodes have a non-NULL `initial_portfolio_value`.
- Ensure the fix works with parallel training (multiple workers).
- Document the issue and solution for future reference.

## üìã Checklist
- [ ] Analyze the `DatabaseLoggingCallbacks` implementation in `reinforcestrategycreator/callbacks.py` to understand how episodes are created and how the `initial_portfolio_value` is set.
- [ ] Identify why the `initial_portfolio_value` is NULL for some episodes.
- [ ] Implement a fix to ensure the `initial_portfolio_value` is properly set for all episodes.
- [ ] Test the fix by running a training session and verifying that all episodes have a non-NULL `initial_portfolio_value`.
- [ ] Document the issue and solution.

## ü™µ Log / Notes
- 2025-05-15 23:55:00 (roo-commander): Task created and assigned to `lead-backend` based on the findings from the autonomous testing and iteration loop (TASK-COORD-20250515-214833). During the testing, 63 out of 315 episodes had NULL values in the `initial_portfolio_value` column, which had to be fixed with a post-processing script. This task aims to address the root cause of this issue.
