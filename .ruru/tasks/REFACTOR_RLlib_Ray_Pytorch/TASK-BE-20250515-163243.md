# Fix Database Logging for Episodes in RLlib Parallel Training

## üéØ Goal
Fix the database logging functionality to ensure that episodes are properly logged with all required metrics in the database during RLlib parallel training.

## üìù Description
While the training script now runs without errors after fixing the replay buffer issue, the episodes are not being properly logged in the database. Episodes are created with a "started" status, but critical metrics (initial_portfolio_value, final_portfolio_value, pnl, sharpe_ratio, etc.) are all NULL values and not being updated when episodes complete.

This issue needs to be fixed to ensure that the database contains complete and accurate information about training episodes, which is essential for the autonomous testing loop and for analyzing training results.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- Identify the root cause of the incomplete episode logging in the database.
- Implement a fix that ensures all critical metrics are properly logged in the database for each episode.
- Verify that episodes in the database have complete information after a training run, including:
  - initial_portfolio_value
  - final_portfolio_value
  - pnl
  - sharpe_ratio
  - max_drawdown
  - total_reward
  - total_steps
  - win_rate
- Ensure the fix works with parallel training (multiple workers).
- Document the issue and solution for future reference.

## ü™µ Log / Notes
- 2025-05-15 16:32:43 (roo-commander): Task created and assigned to `dev-python` based on database query showing episodes with NULL values for critical metrics.
- 2025-05-15 16:37:51 (dev-python): Analyzed `callbacks.py`. Identified a misplaced `except` block in `_log_episode_end_data` as the likely cause for metrics not being logged. Removed the problematic block. Next step is to test the fix.
- 2025-05-15 16:42:08 (dev-python): Modified `_log_episode_end_data` in `callbacks.py` to include a fallback mechanism. If `episode.last_info_for()` is insufficient, it now attempts to retrieve metrics from `actual_env.cached_final_info_for_callback`. This should improve reliability in accessing the fully populated metrics dictionary from the `TradingEnv`.
- 2025-05-15 16:47:05 (dev-python): Updated `_log_episode_end_data` in `callbacks.py` to prioritize `env_runner.env.cached_final_info_for_callback` (accessed via `kwargs`) as the primary fallback if `episode.last_info_for()` is insufficient, before attempting the `base_env` and `env_index` fallback. This aligns with the available parameters observed in `callbacks_debug.log`.
- 2025-05-15 16:55:08 (dev-python): Corrected `on_episode_end` to properly pass `env_runner` (from its `kwargs`) as the `worker` argument to `_log_episode_end_data`. Modified `_log_episode_end_data` to use its `worker` parameter (which is now the `env_runner` or `RolloutWorker`) and `base_env` parameter (which is now the actual `TradingEnv` instance) to access `cached_final_info_for_callback` as a fallback.
- 2025-05-15 16:58:52 (dev-python): Refined fallback logic in `_log_episode_end_data` to correctly access the underlying `TradingEnv` instance from `worker.env.envs[0]` when `worker` is a `SingleAgentEnvRunner` (and `worker.env` is `SyncVectorEnv`), before trying `base_env`. This addresses the issue identified in the latest `callbacks_debug.log`.
- 2025-05-15 17:02:31 (dev-python): Further refined fallback logic in `_log_episode_end_data` for clarity and robustness in accessing `cached_final_info_for_callback` via `worker.env.envs[0]` or `base_env`.
- 2025-05-15 17:07:30 (dev-python): Simplified and reordered fallback logic in `_log_episode_end_data`. Primary fallback is now `base_env.cached_final_info_for_callback` (as `on_episode_end` should correctly pass the `TradingEnv` as `base_env`), with `worker.env.envs[0]` as a secondary check.
- 2025-05-15 17:11:16 (dev-python): Updated `on_episode_end` to more robustly determine and pass the actual `TradingEnv` instance as `base_env` to `_log_episode_end_data`, primarily by accessing `env_runner.env.envs[0]`.
- 2025-05-15 17:14:48 (dev-python): Further refined `on_episode_end` to handle potential Gymnasium wrappers like `DictInfoToList` when trying to access the underlying `TradingEnv` from `env_runner.env`.
- 2025-05-15 17:19:45 (dev-python): Implemented more robust unwrapping logic in `on_episode_end` to iteratively unwrap the environment stack and then the specific environment instance from the vector env to reliably find the `TradingEnv`.
- 2025-05-15 17:23:53 (dev-python): Modified `_log_episode_end_data` to filter `trade_data` from `info['completed_trades']` to only include keys valid for the `DbTrade` model constructor, resolving the `TypeError` for invalid keyword arguments like `entry_step`.
- 2025-05-15 17:26:31 (dev-python): Confirmed with `check_episode_details.py` that all episodes for run `RLlibRUN-SPY-20250515152422-f295ade6` are now fully populated in the database. The combination of robust environment unwrapping in `on_episode_end` and correct trade data filtering in `_log_episode_end_data` has resolved the logging issues.
