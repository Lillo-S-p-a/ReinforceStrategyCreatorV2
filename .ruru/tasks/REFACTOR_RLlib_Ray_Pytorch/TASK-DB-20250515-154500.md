# Define Critical Non-Nullable Columns for Database Validation

## üéØ Goal
Analyze the database schema in `reinforcestrategycreator/db_models.py` and define a comprehensive list of "critical columns" for each table (`episodes`, `steps`, `trades`, `trading_operations`, `training_run`) that **must not** contain NULL values after a successful training run. This list will be used for database validation after parallel training runs.

## üìù Description
As part of our autonomous testing loop for the RLlib/Ray/PyTorch parallel training refactoring, we need to validate that all critical data is properly logged in the database. This task involves analyzing the database schema to identify which columns in each table are critical for data integrity and should never be NULL after a successful training run.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- A structured list of tables and their critical non-nullable columns is provided.
- For each table (`episodes`, `steps`, `trades`, `trading_operations`, `training_run`), the list specifies:
  - Column names that must not be NULL
  - Brief explanation of why each column is critical
  - Any special validation considerations for that column (e.g., numeric ranges, string patterns)
- The list is formatted in a way that can be easily used by a database verification script.
- The analysis considers both schema-level constraints and business logic requirements.

## üìö Related Documents & Context
- `reinforcestrategycreator/db_models.py`: Contains the database schema definitions.
- `.ruru/tasks/REFACTOR_RLlib_Ray_Pytorch/TASK-ARCH-20250515-144808.md`: Parent task for the overall refactoring effort.

## üìã Checklist
- [‚úÖ] Analyze `reinforcestrategycreator/db_models.py` to understand the database schema.
- [‚úÖ] Identify critical columns in the `episodes` table.
- [‚úÖ] Identify critical columns in the `steps` table.

- [‚úÖ] Format the list in a way that can be easily used by a database verification script.
- [‚úÖ] Review the list for completeness and accuracy.
