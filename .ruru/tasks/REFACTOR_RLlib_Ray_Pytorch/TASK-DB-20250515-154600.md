# Create Database Reset Script for Autonomous Testing

## 🎯 Goal
Create or adapt a Python script to reliably and completely empty all data from the tables: `episodes`, `steps`, `trades`, `trading_operations`, and `training_run`. This script will be used as part of an autonomous testing loop to ensure a clean slate for each test iteration.

## 📝 Description
As part of our autonomous testing loop for the RLlib/Ray/PyTorch parallel training refactoring, we need to reset the database before each test run. This task involves creating a script that can be executed to empty all relevant tables in the database.

The script should:
1. Connect to the database using the existing connection utilities.
2. Empty all data from the specified tables.
3. Provide clear output indicating success or failure.
4. Be executable from the command line without manual intervention.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- A Python script that can be executed to reset the database.
- The script empties all data from the tables: `episodes`, `steps`, `trades`, `trading_operations`, and `training_run`.
- The script provides clear output indicating success or failure.
- The script is executable from the command line without manual intervention.
- The script handles errors gracefully and provides meaningful error messages.
- The script uses the existing database connection utilities.

## 📋 Checklist
- [ ] Review existing `init_db.py` script to understand database initialization.
- [ ] Review `reinforcestrategycreator/db_utils.py` to understand database connection utilities.
- [ ] Review `reinforcestrategycreator/db_models.py` to understand table relationships.
- [ ] Create or adapt a script to empty all data from the specified tables.
- [ ] Implement error handling and logging.
- [ ] Test the script to ensure it works as expected.
- [ ] Document the script usage.
