# Fix Blank Plots in Dashboard 'Market Adaptation' Section

## 📝 Description

In the "Market Adaptation" section of the dashboard, two plots are currently rendering as blank areas:
1.  Action Distribution
2.  Action Transitions

The other two plots in this section ("Reward Distribution" and "Running Average Reward") appear to be working correctly.

*(See user-provided image for reference)*

## ❓ Investigation Goal

1.  Identify why the "Action Distribution" and "Action Transitions" plots are not displaying.
2.  Determine if the issue lies in:
    *   Data fetching from the API (e.g., missing data, incorrect endpoint).
    *   Data processing within the dashboard code (`dashboard/main.py`, `dashboard/analysis.py`, `dashboard/visualization.py`).
    *   The plotting functions themselves in `dashboard/visualization.py`.
    *   Missing function calls in `dashboard/main.py`.
3.  Implement the necessary fixes to ensure these plots render correctly with the appropriate data.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

1.  The "Action Distribution" plot displays correctly.
2.  The "Action Transitions" plot displays correctly.
3.  The fixes are integrated without breaking the existing working plots.

## 🚶 Checklist

- [✅] Analyze relevant dashboard code (`dashboard/main.py`, `dashboard/analysis.py`, `dashboard/visualization.py`).
- [✅] Trace the data flow for "Action Distribution" and "Action Transitions".
- [✅] Check API calls and responses related to these plots (if any). (Verified data processing issue based on logs)
- [✅] Debug the plotting functions (`create_action_distribution_plot`, `create_action_transition_matrix` likely names in `visualization.py`).
- [✅] Verify the functions are being called correctly in `main.py`.
- [✅] Implement necessary code fixes.
- [✅] Test the updated visualizations. (User confirmed plots are working)
- [✅] Document findings and fixes in the log. (Log updated throughout)

## 🪵 Log

*   2025-05-05 20:05:57 - Task created by roo-commander to fix blank plots in the Market Adaptation section.
*   2025-05-05 20:14:55 - Debug specialist fixed blank plots by correcting action data type handling in `dashboard/api.py`. Plots should now render.
*   2025-05-05 20:07:58 - **[debug]** Analyzed `main.py` and `visualization.py`. Identified `pd.to_numeric(..., errors='coerce')` in `create_action_analysis` as the likely cause of blank plots due to potential NaN conversion. Removed the problematic line in `visualization.py`.
*   2025-05-05 20:11:21 - **[debug]** Added logging to `visualization.py`. Logs confirmed `action` column in `steps_df` contained only NaN values.
*   2025-05-05 20:12:27 - **[debug]** Identified root cause in `dashboard/api.py`: `fetch_episode_steps` function was incorrectly using `pd.to_numeric` on string actions ('flat', 'long', 'short') instead of mapping them. Removed logging from `visualization.py`. Applied fix to `api.py` to map string actions to numeric (0, 1, 2).
*   2025-05-05 20:14:18 - **[debug]** User confirmed that both 'Action Distribution' and 'Action Transitions' plots are now displaying correctly in the dashboard. Task complete.
