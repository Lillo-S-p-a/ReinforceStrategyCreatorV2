# Refine RL Trading System Explanation Document for Finance Professionals

## Description

We have created a document explaining our reinforcement learning trading system for finance professionals who are not technical experts in machine learning or MLOps. The document needs refinement to be more accessible while maintaining technical accuracy. The document should be in Italian and targeted at finance professionals who understand trading concepts but not necessarily machine learning.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Document maintains bilingual approach (Italian primary with some technical terms in English where appropriate)
- [ ] Content is accurate and explains the reinforcement learning trading system in detail
- [ ] Language is accessible to finance professionals without ML expertise
- [ ] Proper analogies and examples are used to explain technical concepts
- [ ] Visual explanations or suggestions for diagrams are included (actual diagrams not required)
- [ ] Document follows a logical structure that builds knowledge progressively
- [ ] Key trading and finance terminology is used correctly
- [ ] Technical jargon is explained in finance terms where possible
- [ ] Document includes a brief glossary of technical terms
- [ ] Final document is polished, professional, and ready for distribution to finance stakeholders

## Notes

1. The target audience consists of finance professionals who understand trading strategies, portfolio management, and risk metrics but may not be familiar with machine learning concepts.

2. The document should maintain a balance between being accessible and being technically accurate - do not oversimplify to the point of inaccuracy.

3. For any trading or finance terms, assume the reader has professional knowledge. For any ML terms, provide clear explanations or analogies.

4. The document should focus more on the "what" and "why" rather than the technical "how" of implementation.

5. Maintain the existing bilingual approach, with Italian as the primary language but preserving certain technical terms in English where appropriate in the trading/finance domain.
