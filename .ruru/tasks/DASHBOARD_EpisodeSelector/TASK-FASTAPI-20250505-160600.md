# --- User Story ---
# As a user, I want to select a specific training episode from the dashboard
# So that I can analyze the performance and results of different episodes individually.
# --- Acceptance Criteria ---
# - AC1: An API endpoint exists at `/episodes/ids` that returns a JSON list of all distinct episode IDs present in the database.
# - AC2: The existing API endpoint to fetch episode data correctly filters data for the specified `episode_id`.
# - AC3: The dashboard UI displays a dropdown component labeled "Select Episode" instead of the current slider.
# - AC4: The dropdown is populated with the list of episode IDs fetched from the new API endpoint.
# - AC5: Selecting an episode ID from the dropdown triggers an update of all dashboard components to show data only for that episode.
# - AC6: The dashboard defaults to showing the latest episode ID on initial load.

# Implement Episode Selector in Dashboard

## 1. Description

The current dashboard only displays episodes from the latest training run and uses a slider to select between them. This task involves modifying both the API and dashboard to allow users to select any available episode ID across all runs and view the corresponding data.

## 2. Implementation Plan / Checklist

### API Enhancement:
- [âœ…] Create a new endpoint in `reinforcestrategycreator/api/routers/episodes.py` for `/episodes/ids` that:
  - [âœ…] Retrieves all distinct episode IDs from the database
  - [âœ…] Returns them in a structured format (e.g., `{"episode_ids": [1, 2, 3, 47]}`)
  - [âœ…] Sorts the IDs in descending order (newest first)
  - [âœ…] Includes proper error handling and API authentication

### Dashboard Frontend Modification:
- [ ] Add a new function in `dashboard_enhanced_v2.py` to fetch episode IDs from the new API endpoint:
  ```python
  @st.cache_data(ttl=60)
  def fetch_all_episode_ids() -> List[int]:
      """Fetches all available episode IDs from the API."""
      data = fetch_api_data("/episodes/ids")
      if data and "episode_ids" in data:
          return data["episode_ids"]
      st.warning("Could not fetch episode IDs.")
      return []
  ```

- [ ] Replace the episode selection slider (lines 1034-1043) with a dropdown component:
  - [ ] Modify the UI code to use `st.selectbox` instead of `st.slider`
  - [ ] Populate it with values from `fetch_all_episode_ids()`
  - [ ] Set the default value to the most recent episode ID

- [ ] Update the data retrieval logic:
  - [ ] Remove dependency on the specific run_id for episode selection
  - [ ] Ensure all dashboard components update correctly when a different episode is selected
  - [ ] Keep any existing error handling and caching mechanisms
