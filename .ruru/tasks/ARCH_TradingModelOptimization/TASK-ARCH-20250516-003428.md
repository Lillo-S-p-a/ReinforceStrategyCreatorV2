# Task Log: TASK-ARCH-20250516-003428 - Architecture Design: Trading Model Optimization Pipeline

**Goal:** Design the architecture for the trading model optimization pipeline, including components, interfaces, technical requirements, and a technical specification document.

**Context:** User request provided in the initial prompt.

## High-Level Components:

1.  **Data Management Module:** Responsible for fetching, cleaning, and preparing historical and real-time market data. Provides data feeds to other components.
2.  **Model Training Module:** Handles the training of trading models using historical data. Integrates with the Hyperparameter Tuning System.
3.  **Hyperparameter Tuning System:** Manages the process of finding optimal hyperparameters for the trading models. Interacts with the Model Training Module and Model Evaluation Infrastructure.
4.  **Model Evaluation Infrastructure:** Performs rigorous evaluation of trained models using methods like walk-forward analysis and out-of-sample testing. Provides performance metrics to the Sensitivity Analysis Module and Model Selection & Deployment Criteria.
5.  **Sensitivity Analysis Module:** Analyzes the robustness of model performance to changes in parameters or market conditions. Uses results from the Model Evaluation Infrastructure.
6.  **Risk Management Integration:** Incorporates risk metrics and constraints into the evaluation and selection process. Receives input from Model Evaluation and provides input to Model Selection.
7.  **Model Selection & Deployment Criteria:** Defines the rules and criteria for selecting the best performing model and preparing it for deployment (paper or live trading). Uses outputs from Model Evaluation, Sensitivity Analysis, and Risk Management.
8.  **Monitoring System:** Tracks the performance of deployed models in paper trading and compares it against backtest results. Provides data for the Paper-to-Live Transition Framework.
9.  **Paper-to-Live Transition Framework:** Manages the process of transitioning a model from paper trading to live trading based on predefined criteria and monitoring results.
10. **Results Storage & History Tracking:** A central repository for storing all experiment results, model performance metrics, configurations, and historical data used. Ensures reproducibility.
11. **Configuration Management:** Manages all configuration settings for the pipeline components, experiments, and models.
12. **Visualization/Dashboard:** Provides a user interface to visualize results, monitor model performance, and manage experiments.

## Interface Definitions:

*   **Data Flow and Formats:**
    *   Standardized data format (e.g., Pandas DataFrames, Parquet files) for time series data (OHLCV, indicators).
    *   APIs/functions for components to request specific data ranges or types from the Data Management Module.
    *   Clear schema for data passed between Training, Tuning, and Evaluation modules (e.g., features, labels, predictions).
*   **Configuration Management:**
    *   A central configuration service/module.
    *   Configuration defined in structured files (e.g., YAML, JSON).
    *   Components load their configuration from this service at startup or before an experiment run.
    *   Experiment-specific configurations are managed and linked to results.
*   **Common Metric Calculations:**
    *   A shared library or service for calculating standard trading performance metrics (e.g., Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Max Drawdown, Alpha, Beta, Win Rate).
    *   Ensures consistency in evaluation across different models and experiments.
    *   Inputs: Trade logs, portfolio values over time.
    *   Outputs: Standardized metric objects/dictionaries.
*   **Result Storage and History Tracking:**
    *   A well-defined API for components (especially Evaluation, Tuning, Monitoring) to store results.
    *   Results linked to specific experiment runs, configurations, model versions, and data snapshots.
    *   Support for storing raw trade logs, equity curves, performance metrics, hyperparameters, and model artifacts.
    *   Versioning of models and configurations.

## Acceptance Criteria:

*   A technical specification document is created detailing the architecture.
*   The document includes component diagrams, interface definitions, data flow diagrams, and configuration schema.
*   The architecture supports iterative model development.
*   Comprehensive result history is maintained.
*   Reproducibility of experiments is ensured.
