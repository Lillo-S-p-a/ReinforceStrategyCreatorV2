# Task Log: TASK-IMPL-20250516-005023 - Implementation Specifications for Trading Model Optimization Pipeline

**Goal:** Create detailed implementation specifications for each component of the trading model optimization pipeline before coding.

**Context:** Based on the architectural design in `docs/trading_model_optimization_pipeline.md`, we need to create detailed implementation specifications for each component.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- Detailed specification document for each component
- Clear class/function definitions with interfaces
- Dependency mappings between components
- Required libraries and technologies for each component
- Implementation sequence/prerequisites

## Components to Specify:

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. [‚úÖ] Project Structure and Dependencies
2. [ ] Configuration Management System
3. [ ] Results Database Infrastructure
4. [ ] Data Management Module

### Phase 2: Model Training & Evaluation
5. [ ] Model Training Module
6. [ ] Hyperparameter Tuning System
7. [ ] Model Evaluation Infrastructure
8. [ ] Sensitivity Analysis Module

### Phase 3: Risk & Deployment
9. [ ] Risk Management Integration
10. [ ] Model Selection & Deployment
11. [ ] Monitoring System
12. [ ] Paper-to-Live Transition Framework

### Phase 4: Integration
13. [ ] Visualization/Dashboard
14. [ ] System Integration & Testing

## Implementation Approach:
Each specification document will include:
- Component purpose and responsibilities
- Class/module structure
- Function definitions and signatures
- Data structures and types
- Dependencies and interactions
- Error handling approach
- Testing strategy
