This task is a sub-task of TASK-SOLVER-20250513-162000.
The dev-solver, while working on the parent task, reported that logs from `on_episode_start` in `reinforcestrategycreator/callbacks.py` are not appearing in `callbacks_debug.log`.
This prevents analysis of the `episode` object structure, which is crucial for refactoring `on_episode_end` and other callback methods for PyTorch compatibility.
The immediate goal is to ensure `on_episode_start` is being called and that its initial debug logs (e.g., printing `episode.id_`, `type(episode)`) are successfully written to `callbacks_debug.log`.

# Debug: Investigate Missing `on_episode_start` Logs in Callbacks

## 1. Description ✍️

While attempting to execute `TASK-SOLVER-20250513-162000` (Refactor RLlib Integration for PyTorch Compatibility), it was discovered that the `on_episode_start` method within [`reinforcestrategycreator/callbacks.py`](reinforcestrategycreator/callbacks.py) does not appear to be logging any information to [`callbacks_debug.log`](callbacks_debug.log).

This is a critical blocker because the logs from `on_episode_start` are necessary to:
1.  Confirm that the callback is being invoked by RLlib.
2.  Inspect the structure and attributes of the `episode` object (e.g., `episode.id_`, `type(episode)`) in the new PyTorch/RLlib API context.

Without these initial logs, proceeding with the refactoring of `on_episode_end` and other callback logic in the parent task is difficult and prone to error.

## 2. Steps to Reproduce 🚶‍♀️

1.  Ensure the `DatabaseLoggingCallbacks` in [`reinforcestrategycreator/callbacks.py`](reinforcestrategycreator/callbacks.py) has basic debug logging at the beginning of `on_episode_start` (e.g., `logger.debug("on_episode_start called. Episode ID: %s", episode.id_)`).
2.  Run the training script (`train.py` or via `run_train.sh`).
3.  Examine [`callbacks_debug.log`](callbacks_debug.log).

## 3. Expected Behavior ✅

*   The [`callbacks_debug.log`](callbacks_debug.log) should contain log entries from the `on_episode_start` method for each episode started during the training run.
*   These logs should include, at a minimum, confirmation that the method was called and the RLlib episode identifier (e.g., `episode.id_`).

## 4. Actual Behavior ❌

*   No log entries from `on_episode_start` are found in [`callbacks_debug.log`](callbacks_debug.log), suggesting it might not be called, or its logging is failing silently, or it's erroring out before logging.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done) ✅

*   [ ] The root cause for missing `on_episode_start` logs is identified.
*   [ ] Modifications are made to [`reinforcestrategycreator/callbacks.py`](reinforcestrategycreator/callbacks.py) or the RLlib configuration in `train.py` to ensure `on_episode_start` is correctly invoked and can log.
*   [ ] Upon running a training session, [`callbacks_debug.log`](callbacks_debug.log) clearly shows log entries from `on_episode_start`, including `episode.id_` (or equivalent) and `type(episode)`.
*   [ ] The parent task `TASK-SOLVER-20250513-162000` is unblocked.

## 6. Implementation Notes / Root Cause Analysis 📝

*(To be filled by specialist)*

## 7. Checklist / Sub-Tasks 📋

*   [✅] Verify RLlib callback registration in `train.py` ensures `DatabaseLoggingCallbacks` is active.
*   [ ] Add robust `try-except` blocks around logging statements in `on_episode_start` to catch any potential errors during logging itself.
*   [ ] Confirm the logger instance used in `callbacks.py` is correctly configured and not being silenced.
*   [ ] Temporarily add very basic print statements to `on_episode_start` to see if it's being hit at all, if logger issues are suspected.
*   [ ] Review RLlib documentation for any changes to callback lifecycle or registration with the current PyTorch version being used.

## Notes / Logs 📓

*(Specialist will add notes here during task execution)*

*   **2025-05-14 11:53 AM:** Identified that `run_id` in `train.py` was defined *after* the RLlib `config` object, causing the lambda for `DatabaseLoggingCallbacks` to capture an undefined `run_id` at definition time. Moved `run_id` generation and `callback_config` creation to *before* the `config` object definition. Updated `train.py` accordingly. The `callbacks_debug.log` confirmed the callback class itself was initializing and receiving `run_id` correctly from the `legacy_callbacks_dict` during its `__init__`, but the issue was likely with the `on_episode_start` not getting the `run_id` correctly during actual episode execution due to the lambda's closure behavior.
