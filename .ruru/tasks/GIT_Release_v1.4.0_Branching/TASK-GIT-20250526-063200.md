# Git: Release v1.4.0, Update Changelog, Branching & Merge

## 🎯 Goal

Perform all Git operations necessary to release version `v1.4.0`, including updating the changelog, tagging, committing, pushing, creating a release branch, merging to main, and creating a new feature branch for Datadog integration.

## 📝 Description

This task involves multiple sequential Git operations. Please ensure each step is completed successfully before proceeding to the next. The current development branch is assumed to be `mvp-rl-upgrade` (please confirm or use the current active branch if different for the release steps).

**Changelog Update Details:**
The `CHANGELOG.md` needs a new section for `[1.4.0] - 2025-05-26`.
This section should include all notable changes since version `1.2.0`.
Specifically, ensure the feature "Implement new endpoint for strategy parameters" is listed.
Use `git log v1.2.0..HEAD --oneline` or similar commands to identify other changes.

Example structure for the new changelog section:
```markdown
## [1.4.0] - 2025-05-26

### Added
- Implement new endpoint for strategy parameters
- (List other new features identified since v1.2.0)

### Changed
- (List changes identified since v1.2.0)

### Fixed
- (List fixes identified since v1.2.0)
```

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

1.  `CHANGELOG.md` is updated with changes for `v1.4.0`.
2.  All changes (including changelog) are committed with the message `chore: release v1.4.0`.
3.  An annotated tag `v1.4.0` is created with the message "Release version 1.4.0".
4.  The commit and tag `v1.4.0` are pushed to the remote repository.
5.  A new branch named `v1.4.0` is created from the `v1.4.0` tag and pushed.
6.  The current development branch (e.g., `mvp-rl-upgrade`) is successfully merged into the `main` branch.
7.  The `main` branch is pushed to the remote repository.
8.  A new branch named `feature/datadog-integration` is created from `main` and pushed to the remote.
9.  This task status is updated to "🟢 Done" upon successful completion of all steps.

## 📋 Checklist

**Phase 1: Release Preparation & Tagging (on current development branch, e.g., `mvp-rl-upgrade`)**
- [✅] Identify changes made since the `v1.2.0` tag (or the last relevant tag if `v1.2.0` is not the direct predecessor).
- [✅] Update `CHANGELOG.md` by adding a new section for `## [1.4.0] - 2025-05-26` and populating it with the identified changes. Ensure "Implement new endpoint for strategy parameters" is included.
- [✅] Stage the updated `CHANGELOG.md` and any other pending uncommitted changes relevant to this release.
- [✅] Commit all staged changes with the exact commit message: `chore: release v1.4.0`.
- [✅] Create an annotated tag `v1.4.0` with the message "Release version 1.4.0" pointing to the release commit.
- [✅] Push the release commit to the remote repository (e.g., `git push origin mvp-rl-upgrade`).
- [✅] Push the `v1.4.0` tag to the remote repository (e.g., `git push origin v1.4.0`).

**Phase 2: Release Branch Creation**
- [✅] Create a new branch named `v1.4.0` from the `v1.4.0` tag (e.g., `git checkout -b v1.4.0 v1.4.0`).
- [✅] Push the new `v1.4.0` branch to the remote repository (e.g., `git push origin v1.4.0`).

**Phase 3: Merge to Main**
- [✅] Checkout the `main` branch (e.g., `git checkout main`).
- [✅] Pull the latest changes on `main` to ensure it's up-to-date (e.g., `git pull origin main`).
- [✅] Merge the current development branch (e.g., `mvp-rl-upgrade`, which now contains the v1.4.0 release commit) into `main` (e.g., `git merge mvp-rl-upgrade`). Resolve any conflicts if they arise.
- [✅] Push the `main` branch to the remote repository (e.g., `git push origin main`).

**Phase 4: New Feature Branch Creation**
- [✅] Ensure you are on the `main` branch (or checkout `main` if not).
- [✅] Create a new branch named `feature/datadog-integration` from `main` (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/datadog-integration`).
- [✅] Push the new `feature/datadog-integration` branch to the remote repository (e.g., `git push origin feature/datadog-integration`).

**Phase 5: Finalization**
- [✅] Update this task's status to "🟢 Done".
