# Task: Fix NameError: name 'np' is not defined in dashboard/api.py

## 1. Description

The user encountered a `NameError` when running the dashboard after the recent changes. The traceback indicates that `np` (NumPy) was used in `dashboard/api.py` on line 113 without being imported first.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

*   Add the necessary import statement (`import numpy as np`) to the top of `dashboard/api.py`.
*   Verify that the dashboard runs without the `NameError`.

## 3. Checklist

*   [‚úÖ] Add `import numpy as np` to `dashboard/api.py`.
*   [‚úÖ] Test running the dashboard (`run_dashboard.py` or `dashboard/main.py`) to confirm the error is resolved.

## 4. Implementation Notes & Logs

*   2025-05-05 22:10: Added `import numpy as np` to `dashboard/api.py` at line 5.
*   2025-05-05 22:10: Executed `python run_dashboard.py`. Script completed successfully (exit code 0) without the `NameError`. Fix confirmed.
*(Backend specialist will add notes here during execution)*
