# Coordinate Investigation: AttributeError in train.py

## 1. User Request

User reported the following error when running `poetry run python3 train.py`:
```

```
The primary goal is to understand and resolve the `AttributeError`.

## 2. Initial Plan & Delegation

*   **2025-05-14 11:55 AM (User Time):** Proposed plan to delegate to `dev-solver`.
    *   Analyze `AttributeError: 'MessageFactory' object has no attribute 'GetPrototype'`.
    *   Investigate CUDA/cuDNN/cuBLAS warnings and "computation placer" messages.
    *   Propose a solution.
    *   (Optional) Implement the solution.
*   **2025-05-14 11:56 AM (User Time):** User approved the plan.

## 3. Delegation to `dev-solver`

*   **Task ID:** `TASK-SOLVER-20250514-115800`
*   **Assigned Mode:** `dev-solver`
*   **MDTM File:** `.ruru/tasks/INVESTIGATE_TrainPyAttributeError/TASK-SOLVER-20250514-115800.md`

## 4. Log & Updates

*   **2025-05-14 11:57:00Z (System Time):** Created this coordination task file.
*   **2025-05-14 11:58:00Z (System Time):** Created MDTM task file `.ruru/tasks/INVESTIGATE_TrainPyAttributeError/TASK-SOLVER-20250514-115800.md` for `dev-solver`.
*   **(Proceeding with delegation to `dev-solver`)**
