# Investigate Agent Inactivity (Not Taking Trading Actions)

## 1. Description

The user observed that during recent training runs (even after Phase 1 enhancements and initial tuning), the RL agent appears to be inactive, consistently choosing the 'Flat' action and not entering Long or Short positions.

This task requires a detailed investigation into the agent's decision-making process and the environment interaction to determine the cause of this inactivity.

Focus areas:
1.  Confirm the inactivity by running a short training (10 episodes) and analyzing the `trading_operations` in the database for the resulting run.
2.  Analyze Q-Values: Add logging within `rl_agent.py`'s `select_action` method to inspect the predicted Q-values for each action (Flat, Long, Short) just before the `argmax` selection. Is the Q-value for 'Flat' consistently the highest?
3.  Analyze Rewards: Examine the rewards being generated by the environment (`trading_environment.py`). Are the rewards predominantly negative or zero, potentially teaching the agent that *any* action is worse than doing nothing? Check the balance of reward components (Sharpe, penalties).
4.  Check Exploration (Epsilon): Verify the epsilon value and decay (`AGENT_EPSILON`, `AGENT_EPSILON_DECAY`, `AGENT_EPSILON_MIN`). Is exploration sufficient, or is epsilon decaying too quickly, causing the agent to get stuck in exploitation mode early?
5.  Review State/Normalization: Double-check the state representation being fed to the agent and the normalization process. Are there any anomalies or issues that might lead to poor Q-value predictions?
6.  Review Risk Management: Are the stop-loss or other risk parameters overly restrictive, making potential entries immediately unattractive based on predicted risk?
7.  Review Agent Learning: Is the `agent.learn()` method being called frequently enough? Are the target network updates happening correctly?

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

*   A short training run (10 episodes) is executed to reproduce and confirm the inactivity.
*   Analysis of Q-values, rewards, epsilon, state, and risk parameters is performed.
*   The root cause(s) of the agent's inactivity are identified.
*   Specific code changes or parameter adjustments to fix the inactivity are proposed or implemented.
*   Findings, analysis steps, and proposed solutions are documented in this task file.
*   Any necessary code changes are committed to the `feature/rl-strategy-enhancements` branch.

## 3. Checklist

*   [ ] Run `train.py` for 10 episodes.
*   [ ] Query `trading_operations` for the new run_id to confirm inactivity (mostly HOLD operations).
*   [ ] Add temporary logging to `rl_agent.select_action` to print Q-values before `argmax`.
*   [ ] Rerun a short training/evaluation step to observe Q-values.
*   [ ] Analyze the reward calculation logic and typical reward values received by the agent.
*   [ ] Check epsilon parameters and decay schedule in `train.py` and `rl_agent.py`.
*   [ ] Review state normalization logic in `trading_environment.py`.
*   [ ] Review risk management parameters (`ENV_STOP_LOSS_PCT`, `ENV_RISK_FRACTION`) in `train.py`.
*   [ ] Review agent learning frequency (`AGENT_BATCH_SIZE`, `agent.learn()` calls).
*   [ ] Identify root cause(s).
*   [ ] Propose/implement fix(es).
*   [ ] Document findings and solution.
*   [ ] Commit changes if any code was modified.
