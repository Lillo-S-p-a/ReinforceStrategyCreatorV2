# 🐞 Bug Report: Fix AttributeError in TradingEnv

## Description

The `train.py` script failed during execution due to an `AttributeError` when calling `env.get_completed_trades()`. The error indicates that the `TradingEnv` instance does not have the `_completed_trades` attribute, which is accessed within the `get_completed_trades` method itself.

## Error Details

**File:** `train.py`, line 224
**File:** `reinforcestrategycreator/trading_environment.py`, line 517

**Traceback:**
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/alessiorocchi/Projects/ReinforceStrategyCreatorV2/train.py", line 224, in main
    completed_trades = env.get_completed_trades()
                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  File "/Users/alessiorocchi/Projects/ReinforceStrategyCreatorV2/reinforcestrategycreator/trading_environment.py", line 517, in get_completed_trades
    return list(self._completed_trades)
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AttributeError: 'TradingEnv' object has no attribute '_completed_trades'. Did you mean: 'get_completed_trades'?
```

## Acceptance Criteria

*   The `AttributeError` related to `_completed_trades` is resolved.
*   The `train.py` script can run to completion (or the next logical step/error) without this specific error.
*   The `get_completed_trades` method functions as intended, returning the list of completed trades.

## ✅ Checklist

*   [✅] Investigate the `TradingEnv` class in `reinforcestrategycreator/trading_environment.py`.
*   [✅] Verify if `_completed_trades` is initialized correctly in the `__init__` method. Check for typos (e.g., `completed_trades` vs `_completed_trades`).
*   [✅] Correct the attribute name or add the necessary initialization (e.g., `self._completed_trades = []` in `__init__`).
*   [✅] Ensure completed trades are correctly appended to `self._completed_trades` during the environment steps. (Also fixed key mismatches with DB logging)
*   [✅] Test the fix by running `poetry run python train.py`. (Confirmed successful run)
*   [✅] Update this task file status and checklist upon completion.

## 🪵 Logs / Notes
* Initialized `self._completed_trades = []` in `TradingEnv.__init__`.
* Added `self._entry_price` and `self._entry_step` attributes.
* Modified `_execute_trade_action` to record entry details and append completed trade details (including PnL, timestamps) to `self._completed_trades` when positions are closed.
* Corrected key mismatches (`shares`->`quantity`, `position_type`->`direction`, `profit_loss`->`pnl`, `exit_fee`->`costs`) between `trade_details` dict and `Trade` DB model expectations in `train.py`.
* Added debug logging to `train.py` to diagnose key errors, then removed it.
* Confirmed successful run of `train.py` without errors.
