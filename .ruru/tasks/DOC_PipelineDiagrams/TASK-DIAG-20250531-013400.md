# Create Mermaid Diagrams for ReinforceStrategyCreator Pipeline Documentation

## Description ✍️

*   **What needs to be created?** Mermaid diagrams for the `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline` documentation.
*   **Why is it needed?** To visually represent complex aspects of the pipeline, enhancing understanding for the target audience.
*   **Target Audience (for context):** Data Scientists, Quant Analysts, ML Engineers.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Review the documentation outline produced by `core-architect` in task `TASK-ARCH-20250531-013000.md`, specifically identifying all requested Mermaid diagrams and their descriptions.
    *   Create accurate and clear Mermaid diagrams for each specified point.
    *   Ensure diagrams are syntactically correct and render properly.
    *   Save each Mermaid diagram as a separate `.md` file containing *only* the Mermaid code block.
    *   Proposed output directory for diagram files: `.ruru/docs/pipeline/diagrams/`. Filenames should be descriptive (e.g., `overall_system_flow.md`, `data_ingestion_flow.md`).

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

*   - [ ] All Mermaid diagrams specified in the architect's outline (`TASK-ARCH-20250531-013000.md`) are created.
*   - [ ] Diagrams accurately represent the intended pipeline aspects.
*   - [ ] Diagrams are clear, well-structured, and visually appealing.
*   - [ ] Mermaid syntax is correct for all diagrams.
*   - [ ] Each diagram is saved in its own `.md` file in the `.ruru/docs/pipeline/diagrams/` directory (or an agreed alternative).
*   - [ ] Filenames for diagram files are descriptive and follow a consistent convention.
*   - [ ] A list of created diagram file paths is provided upon completion.

## Implementation Notes / Content Outline 📝

*   Refer to the "Implementation Notes / Content Outline" section and "Acceptance Criteria" within `.ruru/tasks/DOC_PipelineAnalysis/TASK-ARCH-20250531-013000.md` to understand the context and requirements for each diagram.
*   Focus on translating the descriptions into effective Mermaid diagrams.
*   If any diagram specification is unclear, consult the `core-architect` (referencing `TASK-ARCH-20250531-013000`) or `util-writer` (referencing `TASK-WRITER-20250531-013325`).
