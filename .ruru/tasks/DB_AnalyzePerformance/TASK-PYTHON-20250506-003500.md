# Analyze Database for Recent Run Performance (Sharpe, Tx Freq)

## 1. Description

The user has observed potentially low transaction frequency and low Sharpe ratios after the Phase 1 enhancements were implemented on the `feature/rl-strategy-enhancements` branch.

This task requires querying the `chats.db` SQLite database to analyze the performance metrics of the most recent completed training run(s).

Specifically, calculate and report:
1.  The average `sharpe_ratio` across all episodes for the latest completed `TrainingRun`.
2.  The average number of trading operations (excluding `OperationType.HOLD`) per episode for the latest completed `TrainingRun`.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

*   A Python script or interactive session connects to `chats.db`.
*   The script identifies the `run_id` of the most recent `TrainingRun` with `status='completed'`.
*   The script queries the `episodes` table for all episodes associated with that `run_id` and calculates the average `sharpe_ratio`.
*   The script queries the `trading_operations` table for all operations associated with those episodes, counts non-HOLD operations per episode, and calculates the average count.
*   The results (average Sharpe, average non-HOLD operations/episode) are clearly reported.
*   A brief interpretation of the findings in relation to the user's observations is provided.
*   The analysis results are documented in this task file.

## 3. Checklist

*   [✅] Identify necessary SQLAlchemy models (`TrainingRun`, `Episode`, `TradingOperation`, `OperationType`).
*   [✅] Establish connection to `trading_db` (PostgreSQL) using SQLAlchemy.
*   [✅] Write query to find the `run_id` of the latest completed `TrainingRun`.
*   [✅] Write query to get `sharpe_ratio` for all episodes of the identified run(s).
*   [✅] Calculate average Sharpe ratio.
*   [✅] Write query to count non-HOLD `TradingOperation` records per episode for the identified run(s).
*   [✅] Calculate the average number of non-HOLD operations per episode.
*   [✅] Summarize the calculated metrics.
*   [✅] Provide interpretation based on the metrics and user feedback.
*   [✅] Document findings in this task file.

**Findings & Interpretation:**

*   **Latest Completed Run:** `RUN-SPY-20250505215547-118de704`
*   **Average Sharpe Ratio:** -2.1218
    *   This is a significantly negative Sharpe ratio, indicating very poor risk-adjusted returns for this run. The strategy, on average, lost value relative to the risk taken. This confirms the user's observation of low Sharpe ratios.
*   **Average Non-HOLD Operations per Episode:** 61.60
    *   This metric represents the average number of buy/sell actions taken per episode. Whether this is considered "low" depends heavily on the length of an episode (number of steps) and the intended strategy frequency. If episodes are long (e.g., thousands of steps), 61.6 trades might be infrequent. If episodes are short, it could be considered active.
    *   However, given the extremely poor Sharpe ratio, the frequency itself might be less relevant than the *quality* of the trades. The data suggests the agent was actively making poor trading decisions during this run.

**Conclusion:** The analysis confirms the user's observations. The latest completed run exhibits a very poor Sharpe ratio (-2.1218) and a moderate trading frequency (average 61.6 non-HOLD operations/episode). The negative performance suggests issues with the strategy logic implemented in the `feature/rl-strategy-enhancements` branch, leading to detrimental trading actions. Further investigation into the agent's decision-making process during this run is warranted.
