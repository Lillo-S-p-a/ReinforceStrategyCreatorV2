# Fix Dashboard Model Analysis Visualization

## 📝 Description

The "Model Analysis" section of the dashboard has visualization issues:
1.  **Model Parameters:** Displayed as a long, unformatted dictionary string, making it hard to read.
2.  **Model Parameter Profile:** The radar chart shows axes and labels but does not visually represent the actual parameter values with data points or lines.

*(See user-provided image for reference)*

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

1.  Model parameters are displayed in a clear, readable format (e.g., table, formatted list).
2.  The radar chart correctly visualizes the relevant model parameter values.
3.  The fix is integrated into the existing dashboard structure.

## 🚶 Checklist

- [✅] Analyze relevant dashboard code (likely in `dashboard/` directory, e.g., `main.py`, `analysis.py`, `visualization.py`, or frontend components).
- [✅] Identify the cause of the parameter string display issue.
- [✅] Implement a more readable display format for parameters.
- [✅] Identify the cause of the radar chart data display issue.
- [✅] Ensure data is correctly passed to and rendered by the radar chart component. (Fix applied to handle nested params and correct keys)
- [✅] Test the updated visualization with sample data. (Verified display works; reactivity depends on backend data consistency between episodes).
- [ ] Commit changes following project standards (Rule `07`). (Commit task cancelled by user)

## 🪵 Log

*   2025-05-05 19:05:55 - Task created by roo-commander.
*   2025-05-05 19:08:10 - Implemented fix for parameter display (table format) in `dashboard/main.py`.
*   2025-05-05 19:08:10 - Updated radar chart function in `dashboard/visualization.py` for robustness. Code ready for testing.
*   2025-05-05 19:09:58 - Commander Review: Failed. Parameter display shows 'No simple parameters...' and radar chart still lacks data visualization. Re-delegating for fixes.
*   2025-05-05 19:11:18 - Applied fixes to `dashboard/main.py` and `dashboard/visualization.py` to correctly handle potentially nested model parameters for display and radar chart. Code ready for review/testing.
*   2025-05-05 19:12:53 - Commander Review: Passed (Incorrectly). Visualization appears fixed based on running dashboard. Marked task as Done. Proceeding to commit.
*   2025-05-05 19:15:38 - Commander Review 2: Failed. Dashboard shows 'No parameters found in model data.' and empty radar chart. Reverting status and delegating to Debug.
*   2025-05-05 19:32:24 - Commander Review 3: Failed. Debug attempt incomplete. Dashboard still shows 'No parameters found...' and terminal logs Arrow serialization errors and 'Parameter not found' warnings for radar chart. Re-delegating to Debug with specific errors.
*   2025-05-05 19:55:24 - Debug specialist fixed parameter key mismatches in `dashboard/main.py` and `dashboard/visualization.py`. Resolved Arrow error and radar chart warnings. Ready for review.
*   2025-05-05 19:54:35 - Debug: Fixed Arrow error by using st.text for params. Fixed radar chart by using correct API keys. Diagnosed reactivity: UI updates correctly, but backend data for model params was identical across tested episodes, making UI appear static. Original bugs fixed.
*   2025-05-05 19:59:08 - Commit task delegated to dev-git was cancelled by the user. Code fixes are present but not committed.
*   2025-05-05 20:03:39 - Backend investigation (TASK-BACKEND-20250505-200131) confirmed that static run-level parameters returned per episode is the intended API behavior. The visualization correctly displays this intended data. Marking task as Done.
