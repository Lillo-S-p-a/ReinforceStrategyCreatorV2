# Task: Fix Dashboard Handling of API `asset_price` Data

## 1. Description

The backend API endpoint `/api/v1/episodes/{id}/steps/` was updated (see `TASK-BACKEND-20250505-221126`) to return a list of dictionaries containing valid numeric `asset_price` values. However, the Streamlit dashboard still shows "Insufficient data for decision analysis."

Investigation revealed that `dashboard/analysis.py` drops rows where `asset_price` is NaN (`steps_df.dropna(subset=['asset_price'])`). This suggests that NaN values are being introduced during the frontend data processing in `dashboard/api.py` (`fetch_episode_steps` function), likely when converting the API response (list of dicts) to a Pandas DataFrame using `pd.to_numeric(errors='coerce')`.

This task is to investigate why NaNs are appearing in the `asset_price` column in the frontend DataFrame and implement a fix.

## 2. Root Cause Investigation Areas

*   **Data Verification:** In `dashboard/api.py` (`fetch_episode_steps`), verify the exact data type and values received for `asset_price` from the API *before* DataFrame conversion. Are they truly numeric as expected, or are some `None`, strings, or other types? (Add temporary logging if needed).
*   **Pandas Conversion:** Confirm `pd.to_numeric(df['asset_price'], errors='coerce')` is behaving as expected based on the verified input data.
*   **Handling Legitimate NaNs:** If some `asset_price` values *can* legitimately be `None` or missing (e.g., first step of an episode), the `dropna()` in `dashboard/analysis.py` might be too aggressive. Consider alternative handling (e.g., forward/backward fill, ignoring specific calculations for NaN rows) if appropriate, but prioritize ensuring valid numbers are processed correctly first.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

*   Identify precisely why `NaN` values appear in the `asset_price` column of the `steps_df` DataFrame in the frontend code.
*   Implement the necessary fix in `dashboard/api.py` or `dashboard/analysis.py` to correctly process the `asset_price` data received from the API.
*   Ensure the `steps_df` passed to `dashboard/analysis.py` contains valid numeric `asset_price` data where expected.
*   Verify that the dashboard's "Detailed Decision Analysis" section now displays calculated metrics instead of the "Insufficient data" message for episodes where the API provides valid data.
*   Confirm the warning "No valid steps data after dropping NaN asset_price" no longer appears in the logs for valid episodes.

## 4. Checklist

*   [ ] Verify data type/values of `asset_price` received from API in `dashboard/api.py`.
*   [ ] Analyze `pd.to_numeric(errors='coerce')` behavior with actual data.
*   [ ] Identify the exact cause of NaN introduction.
*   [ ] Implement the fix in the appropriate file (`dashboard/api.py` or `dashboard/analysis.py`).
*   [ ] Test the dashboard with a recent episode to confirm the fix.
*   [ ] Check dashboard UI for correct analysis display.
*   [ ] Check logs to ensure the NaN warning is gone.
*   [ ] Update this task file's status and logs.
