## Description

The current metrics logged to TensorBoard for the DQN trading model, primarily via Ray Tune during Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO), are standard RL metrics (episode rewards, lengths, losses, epsilon) but lack crucial trading-specific performance indicators. This task is to analyze the current setup, identify missing financial metrics, implement their calculation, and ensure they are logged to TensorBoard.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **Verification:** Confirm the exact set of metrics currently being logged to TensorBoard during HPO runs (originating from `DQN.train` and propagated through `TrainingEngine` to `HPOptimizer`'s `tune.report()`).
2.  **Metric Identification:** Propose a list of essential trading-specific metrics for comprehensive model evaluation (e.g., Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Max Drawdown, Cumulative P&L, Win Rate, Average Win/Loss per trade, Total Trades).
3.  **Implementation:**
    *   Implement the calculation of these new trading metrics within the `train` method of the DQN model ([`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/models/implementations/dqn.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/models/implementations/dqn.py)). Metrics should ideally be calculated on a per-episode basis.
    *   Consider if any utility functions in [`reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/evaluation/metrics.py`](reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/evaluation/metrics.py) can be leveraged or need to be created.
4.  **Logging Integration:**
    *   Ensure all new metrics are added to the `training_history` dictionary returned by the `DQN.train` method.
    *   Verify that these metrics are subsequently available to `tune.report()` within the `HPOptimizer`'s trainable function, allowing Ray Tune to log them to TensorBoard.
5.  **Code Quality:** Implemented code should be clean, well-commented, and follow project coding standards.

## Checklist

- [âœ…] Verify current TensorBoard metrics from HPO runs.
- [âœ…] Define a list of required trading-specific metrics.
- [âœ…] Implement calculation logic for new metrics in `dqn.py`.
- [âœ…] Add new metrics to `DQN.training_history`.
- [âœ…] Confirm new metrics are reportable by Ray Tune.
- [âœ…] Test the changes to ensure metrics are logged correctly.

## Notes

*   The primary focus is on metrics logged during HPO via Ray Tune.
*   The Markdown documentation for these metrics will be handled in a separate follow-up task.
*   The `TrainingEngine` and `HPOptimizer` files are provided for context on how metrics flow to Ray Tune.
## Required Trading-Specific Metrics

Based on analysis of the MetricsCalculator class and trading model requirements, the following metrics should be integrated into TensorBoard logging during HPO runs:

### Core Performance Metrics
- **Total Return**: Overall portfolio return percentage
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return metric (return per unit of volatility)
- **Sortino Ratio**: Downside risk-adjusted return (focuses on negative volatility)
- **Calmar Ratio**: Return to maximum drawdown ratio

### Risk Metrics
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline in portfolio value
- **Value at Risk (VaR)**: Potential loss at given confidence level
- **Conditional VaR**: Expected loss beyond VaR threshold
- **Volatility**: Standard deviation of returns

### Trading Activity Metrics
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades
- **Profit Factor**: Ratio of gross profit to gross loss
- **Average Win**: Mean profit per winning trade
- **Average Loss**: Mean loss per losing trade
- **Total Trades**: Number of completed trades
- **Long Trades**: Number of long positions
- **Short Trades**: Number of short positions

### Advanced Performance Metrics
- **Information Ratio**: Active return per unit of tracking error
- **Treynor Ratio**: Return per unit of systematic risk (beta)
- **Jensen's Alpha**: Risk-adjusted excess return
- **Beta**: Sensitivity to market movements
- **R-squared**: Correlation with market benchmark

### Drawdown Analysis
- **Current Drawdown**: Current decline from recent peak
- **Drawdown Duration**: Length of current drawdown period
- **Recovery Factor**: Net profit to maximum drawdown ratio

### Implementation Notes
- All metrics should be calculated using the existing MetricsCalculator class
- Metrics should be computed at episode completion and reported via tune.report()
- Consider both episode-level and cumulative metrics for comprehensive evaluation
- Ensure metrics are compatible with TensorBoard's scalar logging format
