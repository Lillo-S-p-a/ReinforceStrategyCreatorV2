# Description

The `train.py` script, despite accepting a `--config` argument after the refactoring in `TASK-DEVPT-20250508-195300`, incorrectly used a hardcoded value for `TRAINING_EPISODES` during the EXP001 run instead of the value specified in `configs/config_EXP001.json`.

This task is to modify `train.py` to ensure that **all** relevant parameters loaded from the specified JSON configuration file reliably override any default values hardcoded in the script. This includes, but is not limited to, `training_episodes` and other parameters within `rl_params`, `env_params`, and `data_params`.

# Acceptance Criteria

1.  When `train.py` is run with the `--config` argument pointing to a valid JSON file (e.g., `configs/config_EXP001.json`), the parameters defined within that file (like `training_episodes`, `agent_gamma`, `env_trading_penalty`, `train_start_date`, etc.) are used for the training run, overriding any default values in the script.
2.  The script still functions correctly if run *without* the `--config` argument, using its internal defaults (though this mode won't be used for the structured workflow).
3.  The fix is implemented and committed to the `feature/rl-optimization-workflow` branch.

# Checklist

- [x] Review parameter loading logic in `train.py`.
- [x] Modify the logic to ensure parameters from the loaded config dictionary correctly overwrite or are used instead of script defaults when `--config` is provided.
- [x] Test running `train.py` *with* `--config configs/config_EXP001.json` (e.g., for 1 episode) and verify from logs/output that the config values (e.g., 500 episodes planned, specific dates) are being acknowledged/used.
- [x] (Optional) Test running `train.py` *without* `--config` to ensure it doesn't break.
- [x] Commit the fix to the `feature/rl-optimization-workflow` branch.

# Notes & Logs
*   This fix is essential for the iterative optimization loop to function correctly.
*   Focus on ensuring the dictionary loaded from JSON properly updates or replaces the script's parameter variables *before* they are used to initialize the agent, environment, or data fetching.
