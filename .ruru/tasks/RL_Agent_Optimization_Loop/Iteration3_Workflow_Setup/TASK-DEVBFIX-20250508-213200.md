# Description

The `evaluate_strategy.py` script, after being refactored in `TASK-DEVPT-20250508-195300`, is failing during the calculation of performance metrics. Specifically, it throws a `NameError: name 'returns' is not defined` when attempting to calculate annualized volatility (and potentially other metrics) within `reinforcestrategycreator/metrics_calculator.py`.

This task is to investigate the root cause of this `NameError` and implement a fix. The issue likely stems from incorrect variable scoping or argument passing between `evaluate_strategy.py` and `metrics_calculator.py` after the refactoring.

# Acceptance Criteria

1.  The `NameError: name 'returns' is not defined` (and any related errors) during metric calculation in `evaluate_strategy.py` is resolved.
2.  Running `poetry run python3 evaluate_strategy.py --config configs/config_EXP001.json` completes successfully without calculation errors.
3.  All required metrics (Total Return vs Benchmark, Sharpe, Sortino, Max Drawdown, Annualized Volatility, Alpha, Beta, Total Trades, Avg Annual Trades) are calculated and reported correctly in the console output and the saved JSON results file.
4.  The fix is implemented on the `feature/rl-optimization-workflow` branch.

# Checklist

- [‚úÖ] Identify the cause of the `NameError` in `metrics_calculator.py` or its invocation from `evaluate_strategy.py`.
- [‚úÖ] Implement the necessary code changes to fix the error (e.g., pass the correct returns series as an argument, define the variable correctly).
- [‚úÖ] Verify the fix by running the evaluation script with the EXP001 config and model (`models/model_EXP001_ep447.keras`).
- [‚úÖ] Confirm all metrics are calculated and displayed without errors.
- [‚úÖ] Commit the fix to the `feature/rl-optimization-workflow` branch.

# Notes & Logs
*   Refer to the output in `evaluation_results_EXP001.json` or the console logs from the previous failed run for the exact traceback.
*   The `calculate_annualized_volatility` function in `metrics_calculator.py` is the likely location of the bug or needs different arguments passed to it.
