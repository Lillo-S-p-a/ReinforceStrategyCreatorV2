# Description

This task is to execute the training script `train.py` for Experiment EXP002.
The experiment uses the configuration defined in `configs/config_EXP002.json`, which specifies 500 training episodes and other parameters.

The `train.py` script has recently been fixed (in `TASK-DEVBFIX-20250508-214200`) to correctly prioritize parameters from the config file.

**Command to run (example):**
`python train.py --config configs/config_EXP002.json`

Ensure the `feature/rl-optimization-workflow` branch is up-to-date before starting.

# Acceptance Criteria

1.  The training script `train.py` is executed successfully using `configs/config_EXP002.json`.
2.  Training completes for the specified 500 episodes.
3.  The trained Keras model is saved to a path similar to `models/model_EXP002_epXXX.keras` (where XXX is the final episode number, e.g., 499 or 500).
4.  A training log file, named `training_log_EXP002.csv`, is generated in the root directory.
5.  The full path to the saved model file and the training log file are reported back.
6.  Any significant errors or warnings encountered during training are logged in this task file.

# Checklist

- [âœ…] Ensure the `feature/rl-optimization-workflow` branch is checked out and up-to-date (includes the `train.py` fix).
- [N/A] Verify `tensorflow-metal` is active if on macOS (should be handled by `poetry install`).
- [ ] Execute `python train.py --config configs/config_EXP002.json`.
- [ ] Monitor the training process for completion or errors.
- [ ] Confirm the model file (e.g., `models/model_EXP002_ep499.keras`) is created.
- [ ] Confirm the training log (`training_log_EXP002.csv`) is created.
- [ ] Record the paths to the saved model and training log.

# Notes & Logs
*   This run aims to establish a more robust baseline with a sufficient number of training episodes.
