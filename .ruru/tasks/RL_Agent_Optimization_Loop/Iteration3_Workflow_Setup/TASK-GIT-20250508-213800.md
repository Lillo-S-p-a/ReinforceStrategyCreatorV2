feat(rl-workflow): Setup structured optimization workflow & run EXP001

Refactors train.py and evaluate_strategy.py to support a structured
optimization workflow driven by configuration files. Introduces separate
train/test splits, additional evaluation metrics (Sortino, Volatility,
Alpha, Beta, Trade Count), parameterized transaction costs, and
standardized output naming using Experiment IDs.

Includes fixes for metrics calculation bugs identified after initial
refactoring.

Runs baseline Experiment EXP001 (10 episodes actual, 0.005 penalty)
using the new workflow.

Hypothesis (EXP001): Establish baseline with new workflow.
Result (EXP001): Objectives not met (Sharpe: -1.65, Return: -4.95% vs SPY 2.65%, Trades: 66/yr).
