# Description

This task is to evaluate the performance of the RL agent model trained in Iteration 1 (`TASK-TRAIN-20250506-193200`, model: `models/episode_20_model.keras`) using the `evaluate_strategy.py` script.

The evaluation will compare the agent's performance against the SPY benchmark for the period 2020-01-01 to 2023-12-31, focusing on Sharpe Ratio, Total Return %, and Max Drawdown.

**Key Steps:**

1.  **Ensure Correct Branch:** Verify that you are on the `feature/rl-strategy-enhancements` git branch.
2.  **Execute Evaluation Script:** Run `evaluate_strategy.py` with the following parameters:
    *   `--model-path models/episode_20_model.keras`
    *   `--start-date 2020-01-01` (default, but good to be explicit)
    *   `--end-date 2023-12-31` (default, but good to be explicit)
    *   `--risk-free-rate 0.0` (default, confirm if different needed)
    *   Consider using `--output-file .ruru/tasks/RL_Agent_Optimization_Loop/Iteration1/evaluation_results_iter1.json` (or similar) to save structured results.
3.  **Capture Results:** Record the output from the script, specifically the performance metrics for both the agent and SPY.
4.  **Verify Script Functionality (Completes TASK-DEVPT-20250506-191500 checklist):**
    *   Confirm the script runs without errors using the new model.
    *   Briefly verify that the metrics appear reasonable (e.g., not NaN, within plausible ranges). This serves as the initial testing for `evaluate_strategy.py`.

# Acceptance Criteria

*   The `evaluate_strategy.py` script is successfully executed using the model from Iteration 1 (`models/episode_20_model.keras`).
*   Performance metrics (Sharpe Ratio, Total Return %, Max Drawdown) for both the agent and SPY are generated and recorded.
*   The `evaluate_strategy.py` script is confirmed to be working correctly with a model from the training loop.
*   The results are reported back to the coordinator (`TASK-CMD-20250506-191200`).

# Checklist

- [✅] Verify current git branch is `feature/rl-strategy-enhancements`.
- [✅] Execute `evaluate_strategy.py --model-path models/episode_20_model.keras`.
- [✅] Capture and record the performance metrics output.
- [✅] Confirm `evaluate_strategy.py` functions correctly and metrics are plausible.
- [✅] Update this task status (e.g., "🟢 Done") and report completion, including the metrics, to the coordinator.
