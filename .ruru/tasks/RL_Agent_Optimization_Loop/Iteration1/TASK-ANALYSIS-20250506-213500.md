# Description

The first iteration of the RL agent training and evaluation (`TASK-EVAL-20250506-210600`) has been completed. The agent underperformed the SPY benchmark.

This task is to:
1.  Analyze the performance metrics from Iteration 1 (see `TASK-EVAL-20250506-210600` and `evaluation_results_iter1.json`).
2.  Review the initial tuning recommendations provided in `TASK-PYTHON-20250506-005600`.
3.  Based on a heuristic analysis of the current results and prior recommendations, propose specific parameter changes for Iteration 2. These changes might involve:
    *   Hyperparameters in `train.py` (e.g., learning rate, batch size, discount factor, network architecture).
    *   Environment settings in `reinforcestrategycreator/trading_environment.py` (e.g., transaction costs, observation space features if configurable).
    *   Number of training episodes for the next run.
4.  Document the rationale for the proposed changes.

**Iteration 1 Performance Summary (for context):**
*   **RL Agent (models/episode_20_model.keras):**
    *   Total Return: -0.02%
    *   Sharpe Ratio: 0.00
    *   Max Drawdown: 3.01%
*   **SPY Benchmark:**
    *   Total Return: 55.81%
    *   Sharpe Ratio: 0.04
    *   Max Drawdown: 33.72%

# Acceptance Criteria

*   A clear analysis of the Iteration 1 results is documented.
*   Specific, actionable parameter changes for Iteration 2 are proposed.
*   The rationale for each proposed change is clearly explained.
*   The output should be a list of proposed changes and their justifications, suitable for implementation in the next step.

**Analysis of Iteration 1 Underperformance (2025-05-06 by dev-python):**

The RL agent's performance in Iteration 1 (Total Return: -0.02%, Sharpe Ratio: 0.00) was drastically inferior to the SPY benchmark (Total Return: 55.81%, Sharpe Ratio: 0.04). This indicates that the agent failed to learn a profitable trading strategy.

Key observations and potential reasons:
1.  **Insufficient Training Duration:** The model evaluated was `episode_20_model.keras`. Training for only 20 episodes is highly unlikely to be sufficient.
2.  **Suboptimal Hyperparameters:** Learning rate, discount factor, batch size, or exploration parameters might be poorly tuned.
3.  **Inadequate Network Architecture:** The neural network (2 Dense layers of 64 units) might be too simple.
4.  **Reward Function Design:** The reward function (simple P&L change, as Sharpe was disabled) might not be effectively guiding the agent.
5.  **Observation Space:** Features provided to the agent might be insufficient or not properly scaled.

**Hypothesis for Improvement:**
The most significant factor is likely the extremely short training duration. Increasing training episodes substantially is the primary hypothesis. Adjusting key hyperparameters (learning rate, gamma, epsilon decay) and reward function components (penalties, Sharpe ratio) are secondary.

**Proposed Parameter Changes for Iteration 2 (to be applied in `train.py`):**

1.  **`TRAINING_EPISODES`:**
    *   **Current:** `20`
    *   **Proposed:** `1000`
    *   **Rationale:** Essential for allowing the agent sufficient experience to learn.

2.  **`AGENT_GAMMA` (Discount Factor):**
    *   **Current:** `0.90`
    *   **Proposed:** `0.99`
    *   **Rationale:** Encourage consideration of more distant future rewards, suitable for long-term trading profitability.

3.  **`AGENT_EPSILON_DECAY`:**
    *   **Current:** `0.995`
    *   **Proposed:** `0.9999`
    *   **Rationale:** With significantly more training episodes, epsilon decay needs to be slower to ensure sustained exploration. This rate allows epsilon to reach its minimum value over approximately 46,000 steps.

4.  **`AGENT_TARGET_UPDATE_FREQ`:**
    *   **Current:** `50`
    *   **Proposed:** `100`
    *   **Rationale:** A slightly less frequent update can provide more stability to target Q-values.

5.  **`ENV_DRAWDOWN_PENALTY`:**
    *   **Current:** `0.005`
    *   **Proposed:** `0.05`
    *   **Rationale:** Increase penalty to better guide the agent against excessive drawdowns. Current penalty is very low.

6.  **`ENV_TRADING_PENALTY`:**
    *   **Current:** `0.002`
    *   **Proposed:** `0.005`
    *   **Rationale:** Increase penalty to discourage over-trading if it's not profitable. Current penalty is very low.

7.  **`use_sharpe_ratio` (in `TradingEnv` initialization):**
    *   **Current:** `False`
    *   **Proposed:** `True`
    *   **Rationale:** Re-enabling Sharpe ratio in the reward calculation can guide the agent towards better risk-adjusted returns.

**Summary of Proposed Changes for `train.py` for Iteration 2:**
*   `TRAINING_EPISODES = 1000`
*   `AGENT_GAMMA = 0.99`
*   `AGENT_EPSILON_DECAY = 0.9999`
*   `AGENT_TARGET_UPDATE_FREQ = 100`
*   `ENV_DRAWDOWN_PENALTY = 0.05`
*   `ENV_TRADING_PENALTY = 0.005`
*   When initializing `TradingEnv`: `use_sharpe_ratio=True`

**Note on Missing File:** The initial tuning recommendations file (`TASK-PYTHON-20250506-005600.md`) was not found. The above proposals are based on Iteration 1 results and general RL best practices.
