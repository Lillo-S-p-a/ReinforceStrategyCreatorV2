# Description

This task is for the first training iteration of the RL agent as part of the optimization loop managed by `TASK-CMD-20250506-191200`.

The primary goal is to execute the `train.py` script for **20 episodes**.

**Key Steps:**

1.  **Ensure Correct Branch:** Verify that you are on the `feature/rl-strategy-enhancements` git branch. If not, switch to it.
2.  **Execute Training:** Run the `train.py` script.
    *   The number of episodes should be 20 for this iteration. If `train.py` accepts an episode count via CLI argument (e.g., `--episodes 20`), use it. Otherwise, if it needs to be modified in the script, make the change, run, and consider if the change should be committed or if the script should be parameterized for future runs.
3.  **Monitor Training:** Observe the training process for any errors or unusual behavior.
4.  **Locate Saved Model:** Note the path to the saved model checkpoint generated by `train.py` upon completion. This path will be needed for the subsequent evaluation step.
5.  **Log Output:** Capture any significant console output or logs from the training process.

# Acceptance Criteria

*   The `train.py` script is successfully executed for 20 episodes on the `feature/rl-strategy-enhancements` branch.
*   No critical errors occur during training.
*   The path to the saved model checkpoint is identified and reported.
*   Relevant training logs/output are captured.

# Checklist

- [✅] Verify current git branch is `feature/rl-strategy-enhancements`.
- [✅] Configure/Execute `train.py` for 20 episodes. (Note: `poetry install` was skipped, potential for errors)
- [✅] Monitor training for errors. (No critical errors observed in final logs)
- [✅] Identify and record the path of the saved model checkpoint: models/episode_20_model.keras
- [✅] Capture relevant training logs/output. (Run ID: RUN-SPY-20250506181240-6dc6a496)
- [✅] Update this task status (e.g., "🟢 Done") and report completion, including the model path and logs, to the coordinator (`TASK-CMD-20250506-191200`).

# Notes & Logs
*   Initial training run for the optimization loop.
*   The saved model from this run will be used by `evaluate_strategy.py` in the next step of the main loop.
*   Training completed on 2025-05-06. Run ID: RUN-SPY-20250506181240-6dc6a496. Model saved to: models/episode_20_model.keras.
