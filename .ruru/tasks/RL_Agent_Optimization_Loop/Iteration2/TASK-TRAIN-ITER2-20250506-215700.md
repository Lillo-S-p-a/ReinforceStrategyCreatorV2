# Description

This task is for the second training iteration of the RL agent as part of the optimization loop managed by `TASK-CMD-20250506-191200`. The parameters for this iteration were implemented in `TASK-IMPL-20250506-215000`.

The primary goal is to execute the `train.py` script for **1000 episodes** using the updated parameters.

**Key Parameters for this run (already implemented in `train.py`):**
*   `TRAINING_EPISODES = 1000`
*   `AGENT_GAMMA = 0.99`
*   `AGENT_EPSILON_DECAY = 0.9999`
*   `AGENT_TARGET_UPDATE_FREQ = 100`
*   `ENV_DRAWDOWN_PENALTY = 0.05`
*   `ENV_TRADING_PENALTY = 0.005`
*   `TradingEnv` initialization: `use_sharpe_ratio=True`

**Key Steps:**

1.  **Ensure Correct Branch & Code:** Verify that you are on the `feature/rl-strategy-enhancements` git branch and have the latest changes (including those from `TASK-IMPL-20250506-215000`). A `git pull origin feature/rl-strategy-enhancements` might be advisable.
2.  **Execute Training:** Run the `train.py` script. It should now use the updated parameters, including 1000 episodes.
3.  **Monitor Training:** Observe the training process for any errors or unusual behavior. Given the increased episode count, this may take longer.
4.  **Locate Saved Model:** Note the path to the saved model checkpoint generated by `train.py` upon completion (likely after 1000 episodes).
5.  **Log Output:** Capture any significant console output or logs from the training process.

# Acceptance Criteria

*   The `train.py` script is successfully executed for 1000 episodes on the `feature/rl-strategy-enhancements` branch with the Iteration 2 parameters.
*   No critical errors occur during training.
*   The path to the saved model checkpoint is identified and reported.
*   Relevant training logs/output are captured.

# Checklist

- [‚úÖ] Verify current git branch is `feature/rl-strategy-enhancements` and code is up-to-date. (Verified 2025-05-07/08)
- [‚úÖ] Execute `train.py` (Ran for 50 episodes per user request). (Completed 2025-05-08)
- [‚úÖ] Monitor training for errors. (No critical errors observed during 50-episode run)
- [‚úÖ] Identify and record the path of the saved model checkpoint. (Final model: models/episode_427_model.keras)
- [‚úÖ] Capture relevant training logs/output. (Run ID: RUN-SPY-20250508141958-ba351c23)
- [‚úÖ] Update this task status (e.g., "üü¢ Done") and report completion, including the model path and logs, to the coordinator (`TASK-CMD-20250506-191200`).

# Notes & Logs
*   Second training run in the optimization loop.
*   The saved model from this run will be used by `evaluate_strategy.py` in the next step.
*   **Update 2025-05-08 (Previous):** Training run was interrupted after completing episode with DB ID 376 (Run ID: `RUN-SPY-20250507082804-b9f9e126`).
*   **Update 2025-05-08 (Current):** Per user request, re-ran training for 50 episodes.
*   Run ID: `RUN-SPY-20250508141958-ba351c23`
*   Final saved model (Episode 50, DB ID 427): `models/episode_427_model.keras`
*   Task completed successfully for 50 episodes.
