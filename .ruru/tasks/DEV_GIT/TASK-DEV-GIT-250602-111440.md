## 📝 Description

The goal is to integrate changes from the current working Git branch into the 'main' branch using a Pull Request (PR), and then ensure the local 'main' branch is updated.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

-   The current branch's changes are proposed for merging into 'main' via a PR.
-   The PR URL is reported.
-   After the PR is confirmed merged by the user/platform, the local 'main' branch is up-to-date with these changes.
-   Guidance on optional branch cleanup is provided or performed if requested.

## 📋 Checklist

- [✅] Identify the current Git branch.
- [✅] Ensure the current branch is pushed to the remote repository. If not, push it.
- [✅] Create a Pull Request from the current branch to the 'main' branch on the Git hosting platform.
- [✅] Report the URL of the created Pull Request to the coordinator. (URL: https://github.com/Lillo-S-p-a/ReinforceStrategyCreatorV2/pull/3)
- [✅] Await confirmation from the user/coordinator that the PR has been merged on the remote platform.
- [ ] Once PR merge is confirmed:
    - [✅] Switch to the local 'main' branch.
    - [✅] Pull the latest changes for 'main' from the remote repository.
    - [✅] Confirm local 'main' branch is updated.
- [✅] (Optional, based on user preference/repo policy) Offer to delete the local and remote feature branch. If confirmed, proceed with deletion. (Local deleted, remote was already gone)
