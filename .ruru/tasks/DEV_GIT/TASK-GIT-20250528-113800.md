## üìù Description

The previous commit `f92b307` on the `feature/datadog-integration` branch fixed an HPO `AttributeError` by adding the `update_config_with_hpo_params` method to `BacktestingWorkflow` and correcting an indentation error.

The user now requests a more granular and detailed commit history for these changes. This task involves:
1.  Resetting the last commit (`f92b307`) locally while keeping the file changes in the working directory.
2.  Analyzing the changes made to `reinforcestrategycreator/backtesting/workflow.py`.
3.  Identifying if these changes can be logically broken down into multiple distinct topics suitable for separate commits.
4.  For each identified topic, creating a new, detailed, and well-structured commit. If only one logical topic is identified (e.g., "add method and fix related indentation"), create one comprehensive commit.
5.  Force-pushing the new commit history to the `feature/datadog-integration` branch.

**Important:** Force-pushing rewrites history and should be done with caution, especially if others might have pulled the `feature/datadog-integration` branch with commit `f92b307`. Confirm if this branch is actively shared.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

1.  The local `feature/datadog-integration` branch no longer has commit `f92b307` as its HEAD.
2.  The changes originally in `f92b307` (addition of `update_config_with_hpo_params` and indentation fix) are now committed with one or more new, well-structured commit messages.
3.  The new commit(s) clearly explain the purpose and details of the changes.
4.  The new commit history is successfully force-pushed to `origin/feature/datadog-integration`.
5.  This task status is updated to "üü¢ Done".

## üìã Checklist

- [‚úÖ] Ensure the local `feature/datadog-integration` branch is up-to-date with `origin/feature/datadog-integration`.
- [‚úÖ] **Carefully** reset the last commit (`f92b307`) using a command like `git reset HEAD~1`. Ensure the changes are preserved in the working directory.
- [‚úÖ] Analyze the uncommitted changes in `reinforcestrategycreator/backtesting/workflow.py`.
- [‚úÖ] Determine the appropriate number of new commits to make (1 or more, based on logical separation of topics/changes).
- [‚úÖ] For each new commit:
    - [‚úÖ] Selectively stage the relevant parts of the changes (e.g., using `git add -p reinforcestrategycreator/backtesting/workflow.py`).
    - [‚úÖ] Write a detailed and structured commit message adhering to Conventional Commits format. Example for the primary change:
      ```
      feat(backtesting): Add update_config_with_hpo_params to BacktestingWorkflow

      Introduces the `update_config_with_hpo_params` method to the
      `BacktestingWorkflow` class. This method is essential for integrating
      Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) results into the model training process.

      The method updates the `agent_config` within the main workflow
      configuration using the hyperparameters provided by the HPO process.
      Key functionalities include:
      - Validating HPO parameters.
      - Initializing `agent_config` if it's not already present.
      - Selectively updating `agent_config` with known agent hyperparameters
        or pre-existing keys from the HPO results.
      - Comprehensive logging of the update process for traceability.

      This change directly addresses a previous `AttributeError` that occurred
      when this method was called but not yet defined, and ensures that
      optimized hyperparameters are correctly applied.
      ```
    - [‚úÖ] Create the commit.
- [‚úÖ] After all new commits are made, **force-push** the changes to the remote `feature/datadog-integration` branch (e.g., `git push origin feature/datadog-integration --force`).
- [‚úÖ] Verify the remote history on `feature/datadog-integration` reflects the new commit structure.
- [‚úÖ] Update this task's status to "üü¢ Done" and log actions.
