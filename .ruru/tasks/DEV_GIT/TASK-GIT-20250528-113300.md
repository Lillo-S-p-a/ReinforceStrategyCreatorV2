## 📝 Description

The HPO process was failing with an `AttributeError: 'BacktestingWorkflow' object has no attribute 'update_config_with_hpo_params'`.
This was resolved by adding the missing `update_config_with_hpo_params` method to the `BacktestingWorkflow` class in `reinforcestrategycreator/backtesting/workflow.py` and fixing a subsequent indentation error.

This task is to commit these changes and push them to the remote repository.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

1.  All changes in `reinforcestrategycreator/backtesting/workflow.py` are staged.
2.  The changes are committed with the specified commit message.
3.  The commit is pushed to the remote repository (origin/current branch).
4.  The task status is updated to "🟢 Done".

## 📋 Checklist

- [✅] Stage changes for `reinforcestrategycreator/backtesting/workflow.py`.

      ```
      fix(hpo): Add missing update_config_with_hpo_params to BacktestingWorkflow

      Resolves AttributeError during HPO process.

      The 'BacktestingWorkflow' class was missing the 'update_config_with_hpo_params' method, which is called to update the agent's configuration with the best hyperparameters found during optimization.

      This commit introduces the 'update_config_with_hpo_params' method to 'reinforcestrategycreator/backtesting/workflow.py' and corrects a subsequent indentation error that occurred after the initial insertion.
