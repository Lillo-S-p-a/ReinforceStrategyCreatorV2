# Implement Task 7.2: Integration Testing

## Description ✍️

*   **What is this feature?** This task is to implement **Task 7.2: Integration Testing** as defined in the Model Pipeline Implementation Plan ([`.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md`](.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md:343)). The objective is to create a suite of integration tests that verify the interactions between different components of the `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline` and test the pipeline end-to-end.
*   **Why is it needed?** To ensure that components work together as expected, validate data flow through the pipeline, establish performance benchmarks, and catch issues that unit tests might miss.
*   **Scope (from Implementation Plan - Task 7.2):**
    *   Develop integration test scenarios.
    *   Implement end-to-end pipeline tests.
    *   Establish performance benchmarks.
    *   Manage test data for integration tests.
*   **Links:**
    *   Project Plan: [`.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md#task-72-integration-testing`](.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md:343)
    *   Unit Test Suite (Dependency): [`.ruru/tasks/TEST_INTEGRATION/TASK-TESTINT-20250529-194500-UnitTestSuite.md`](.ruru/tasks/TEST_INTEGRATION/TASK-TESTINT-20250529-194500-UnitTestSuite.md)

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

(Derived from Implementation Plan - Task 7.2 Deliverables & Details)
*   - [ ] Key component interactions are tested (e.g., `DataManager` with `DataTransformer`, `TrainingEngine` with `ModelFactory` and `ArtifactStore`).
*   - [ ] End-to-end pipeline execution tests are implemented for common use cases (e.g., training a model from raw data to evaluation).
*   - [ ] Initial performance benchmarks are established for key pipeline operations (e.g., data processing time, model training time).
*   - [ ] A strategy for managing test data (e.g., sample datasets, data generation scripts) for integration tests is in place.
*   - [ ] Integration tests are runnable and provide clear pass/fail status.
*   - [ ] Consideration for performance regression tests.
*   - [ ] Validation of the data pipeline flow.

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks 📝

*   - [ ] Define key integration test scenarios based on the pipeline architecture and component interactions.
*   - [ ] **Component Interaction Tests:**
    *   - [🚧] Test `DataManager` -> `DataTransformer` -> `DataSplitter` flow. (Placeholder created: `test_data_pipeline_flow.py`)
    *   - [🚧] Test `ModelFactory` -> `TrainingEngine` -> `ArtifactStore` (for model saving). (Placeholder created: `test_model_training_flow.py`)
    *   - [🚧] Test `TrainingEngine` -> `EvaluationEngine` (using a trained model artifact). (Placeholder created: `test_evaluation_flow.py`)
    *   - [🚧] Test `DeploymentManager` -> `ModelPackager` -> `PaperTradingDeployer`. (Placeholder created: `test_deployment_flow.py`)
    *   - [🚧] Test `MonitoringService` integration with deployed models/services. (Placeholder created: `test_monitoring_integration.py`)
*   - [ ] **End-to-End Pipeline Tests:**
    *   - [🚧] Develop tests that execute the full pipeline from data ingestion to model evaluation/deployment for a small, representative dataset. (Placeholder created: `test_e2e_pipeline.py`)
    *   - [ ] Verify that artifacts are correctly generated and stored at each stage.
    *   - [ ] Check for consistency in data formats and context propagation.
    *   - [ ] **Note:** Full E2E tests might be limited by the unimplemented `FeatureEngineeringStage`. Focus on testing the flow of currently implemented stages.
*   - [ ] **Performance Benchmarks:**
    *   - [ ] Identify critical pipeline operations for benchmarking.
    *   - [ ] Implement simple timing mechanisms around these operations in test scripts.
    *   - [ ] Establish baseline performance numbers on a consistent test environment.
*   - [ ] **Test Data Management:**
    *   - [ ] Create or identify small, version-controlled sample datasets for integration testing.
    *   - [✅] Store these datasets in an accessible location (e.g., `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/tests/fixtures/data/`).
*   - [ ] Write integration tests using a suitable Python testing framework (e.g., `pytest`).
*   - [✅] Structure integration tests in a dedicated directory (e.g., `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/tests/integration/`).
*   - [ ] Document how to run integration tests and any specific setup required.
