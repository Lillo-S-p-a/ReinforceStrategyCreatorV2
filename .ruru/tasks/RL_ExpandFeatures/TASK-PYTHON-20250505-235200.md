# Expand Technical Features for State Representation

## 1. Description

As part of Phase 1 of the RL strategy enhancements (based on analysis task `TASK-PYTHON-20250505-203900`), this task focuses on expanding the set of technical indicators used to create the agent's state representation. This involves modifying `reinforcestrategycreator/technical_analyzer.py`.

The current feature set is limited (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands). Adding more diverse indicators can provide the agent with a richer understanding of market conditions.

Implement the following recommended indicators (or a subset based on feasibility):
*   Trend Strength: ADX, Aroon Oscillator
*   Volatility: ATR (Average True Range), Historical Volatility (e.g., rolling standard deviation of returns)
*   Consider adding market regime indicators if applicable to the target asset (e.g., VIX for SPY).

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

*   The `TechnicalAnalyzer` class in `reinforcestrategycreator/technical_analyzer.py` is updated to calculate the new indicators (e.g., ADX, Aroon, ATR, Historical Volatility).
*   The `add_indicators` method (or equivalent) correctly incorporates these new features into the DataFrame.
*   The new features are included in the observation space provided by the `TradingEnvironment` (ensure `_get_observation` uses the expanded features).
*   Error handling for indicator calculation is robust.
*   Relevant unit tests are added or updated in `tests/test_technical_analyzer.py` to verify the calculation of the new indicators.
*   Code is committed to the `feature/rl-strategy-enhancements` branch.

## 3. Checklist

*   [✅] Identify appropriate libraries (e.g., `pandas-ta`, `talib`) or implement calculations for ADX, Aroon, ATR, Historical Volatility. (Used pandas-ta and pandas)
*   [✅] Integrate new indicator calculations into `TechnicalAnalyzer`.
*   [✅] Update `add_indicators` to include the new columns. (Handled within `calculate_indicators` using pandas-ta `append=True`)
*   [✅] Verify `TradingEnvironment._get_observation` correctly selects and processes the expanded feature set. (Verified logic, no changes needed)
*   [✅] Add/update unit tests in `tests/test_technical_analyzer.py` for the new indicators.
*   [✅] Ensure backward compatibility or clear configuration options if the feature set change impacts existing models/configs. (New features are added; old ones remain. Existing models might need retraining but the code is compatible).
*   [✅] Test the changes within the existing training loop (`train.py`) to ensure compatibility. (Ran `poetry run python train.py` successfully).
*   [✅] Commit changes to the `feature/rl-strategy-enhancements` branch following commit standards (Rule `07`). (Commit: 03580a4)

## 4. Logs / Notes

*   2025-05-06: Identified `pandas-ta` as suitable library (already in dependencies).
*   2025-05-06: Modified `technical_analyzer.py` to calculate ADX, Aroon, ATR using `pandas-ta` and Historical Volatility using `pandas`. Updated required data checks and docstrings.
*   2025-05-06: Verified `TradingEnvironment` observation logic handles new columns automatically.
*   2025-05-06: Updated `tests/test_technical_analyzer.py` to include tests for new indicators and required columns (High, Low).
*   2025-05-06: Ran `poetry install` and `poetry run python train.py` to confirm compatibility and resolve initial `ModuleNotFoundError`.
*   2025-05-06: Committed changes to `feature/rl-strategy-enhancements` branch (Commit: 03580a4).
*   2025-05-06: Updated task status to Done.
