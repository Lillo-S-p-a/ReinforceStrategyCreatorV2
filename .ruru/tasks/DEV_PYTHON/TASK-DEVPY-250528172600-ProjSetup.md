# Implement Task 1.1: Project Structure Setup for Model Pipeline

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

*   **What is this feature?**
    This task is to implement **Task 1.1: Project Structure Setup** as defined in the Model Pipeline Implementation Plan ([`.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md`](.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md)).
    The objective is to create the directory structure and initial project setup for the new model pipeline.
*   **Why is it needed?**
    This is the foundational step for the entire pipeline implementation, establishing the workspace for all subsequent development.
*   **Scope (from Implementation Plan - Task 1.1):**
    *   Create the directory structure as per the architecture document ([`.ruru/docs/architecture/model_pipeline_v1_architecture.md`](.ruru/docs/architecture/model_pipeline_v1_architecture.md)).
    *   Set up initial Python package configurations (e.g., `__init__.py` files).
    *   Create `setup.py` and `requirements.txt`.
    *   Initialize a git repository with a `.gitignore` file.
*   **Links:**
    *   Implementation Plan: [`.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md#task-11-project-structure-setup`](.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md#task-11-project-structure-setup)
    *   Architecture Document: [`.ruru/docs/architecture/model_pipeline_v1_architecture.md`](.ruru/docs/architecture/model_pipeline_v1_architecture.md) (Refer to "6. Directory Structure" section)

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

(Derived from Implementation Plan - Task 1.1 Deliverables)
*   - [‚úÖ] Complete directory structure for `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/` is created as specified in the architecture document.
*   - [‚úÖ] All necessary `__init__.py` files are created within the packages to make them importable.
*   - [‚úÖ] A basic `setup.py` file for the project is created.
*   - [‚úÖ] A `requirements.txt` file is created (can be initially empty or include very basic dependencies like `python-dotenv`, `pyyaml`).
*   - [‚úÖ] A `.gitignore` file suitable for a Python project is created.
*   - [ ] (Optional, if not already done at a higher level) The `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline` directory is initialized as a Git repository.

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks üìù

*   - [‚úÖ] Carefully review the "6. Directory Structure" section of [`.ruru/docs/architecture/model_pipeline_v1_architecture.md`](.ruru/docs/architecture/model_pipeline_v1_architecture.md).
*   - [‚úÖ] Create the main project directory, e.g., `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline`.
*   - [‚úÖ] Systematically create all subdirectories and package `__init__.py` files.
*   - [‚úÖ] Populate `setup.py` with minimal project metadata.
*   - [‚úÖ] Add common Python ignores to `.gitignore` (e.g., `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.venv/`, `*.egg-info/`, `dist/`, `build/`).
