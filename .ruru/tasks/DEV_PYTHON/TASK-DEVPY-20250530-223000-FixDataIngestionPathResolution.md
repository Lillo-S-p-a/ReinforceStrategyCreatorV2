## üìù Description

The main pipeline (`run_main_pipeline.py`) fails during the `DataIngestionStage` with a `FileNotFoundError`. The path to `dummy_data.csv` is being resolved incorrectly, leading to a duplicated path segment: `/home/alessio/Personal/ReinforceStrategyCreatorV2/reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/dummy_data.csv`.

This needs to be fixed by:
1.  Making the `data.source_path` in `pipeline.yaml` relative to the config file's own location.
2.  Updating `DataIngestionStage.setup()` to resolve this relative path correctly using `ConfigManager.base_path`.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

*   The `data.source_path` in `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/configs/base/pipeline.yaml` is updated to `"../../dummy_data.csv"`.
*   The `setup()` method in `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/pipeline/stages/data_ingestion.py` correctly resolves the `source_path` for CSV files by prepending `self.context.get("config_manager").base_path` if the `source_path` is relative.
*   Running `python run_main_pipeline.py` (from the `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline` directory) no longer raises a `FileNotFoundError` for `dummy_data.csv` in the `DataIngestionStage`.
*   The pipeline proceeds past the `DataIngestionStage` successfully (or fails at a later stage for a different reason).

## üìã Checklist

*   [‚úÖ] **Modify `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/configs/base/pipeline.yaml`**:
    *   Locate the `data:` section.
    *   Change `source_path:` from `"reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/dummy_data.csv"` to `"../dummy_data.csv"` (relative to configs directory).
*   [‚úÖ] **Modify `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/pipeline/stages/data_ingestion.py`**:
    *   In the `DataIngestionStage.setup()` method, specifically where `resolved_source_path` is determined for CSV files:
        *   If `Path(self.source_path)` is not absolute, it should be resolved as:
          `resolved_source_path = (config_manager.loader.base_path / self.source_path).resolve()`
*   [‚úÖ] **Additional fix for `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/data/csv_source.py`**:
    *   Added logic to handle relative paths starting with "../" to ensure the CSV file is found when loaded by the Training stage.
*   [‚úÖ] Test the changes by running `python run_main_pipeline.py` from the `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline` directory. Ensure the `FileNotFoundError` in `DataIngestionStage` is resolved.
