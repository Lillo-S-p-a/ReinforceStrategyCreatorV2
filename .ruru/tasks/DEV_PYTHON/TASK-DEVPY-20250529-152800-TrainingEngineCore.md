# Implement Task 4.2: Training Engine Core

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

*   **What is this feature?** This task is to implement **Task 4.2: Training Engine Core** as defined in the Model Pipeline Implementation Plan ([`.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md`](.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md:193)). The objective is to create the system responsible for executing the training process for machine learning models.
*   **Why is it needed?** To provide a robust and configurable engine for training models, managing training loops, handling callbacks, and collecting metrics.
*   **Scope (from Implementation Plan - Task 4.2):**
    *   Implement a `TrainingEngine` main class.
    *   Develop a system for training callbacks (e.g., for logging, early stopping, model checkpointing).
    *   Implement checkpoint management for saving and resuming training.
    *   Integrate training metrics collection.
*   **Links:**
    *   Project Plan: [`.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md#task-42-training-engine-core`](.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md:193)
    *   Model Factory & Registry Task (Dependency): [`.ruru/tasks/DEV_PYTHON/TASK-DEVPY-20250529-151000-ModelFactoryRegistry.md`](.ruru/tasks/DEV_PYTHON/TASK-DEVPY-20250529-151000-ModelFactoryRegistry.md)
    *   Data Transformation & Validation Task (Dependency): [`.ruru/tasks/DEV_PYTHON/TASK-DEVPY-20250529-125500-DataTransformVal.md`](.ruru/tasks/DEV_PYTHON/TASK-DEVPY-20250529-125500-DataTransformVal.md)

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

(Derived from Implementation Plan - Task 4.2 Deliverables & Details)
*   - [‚úÖ] `TrainingEngine` class is implemented, capable of managing the training loop for a given model and dataset.
*   - [‚úÖ] A flexible callback system is in place, allowing custom actions at various points in the training loop (e.g., `on_epoch_begin`, `on_epoch_end`, `on_batch_end`).
*   - [‚úÖ] Model checkpointing (saving model state periodically and at the end of training) is implemented, leveraging the `ModelRegistry` and `ArtifactStore`.
*   - [‚úÖ] Functionality to resume training from a checkpoint is available.
*   - [‚úÖ] Training metrics (e.g., loss, rewards, custom metrics) are collected during training and can be logged or stored.
*   - [‚úÖ] The `TrainingEngine` integrates with the `ModelFactory` to obtain model instances and the `DataManager` (or equivalent data access mechanism) for training data.
*   - [‚úÖ] Unit tests are provided for the `TrainingEngine` and callback system.

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks üìù

*   - [‚úÖ] Design the `TrainingEngine` class structure and its main `train()` method.
*   - [‚úÖ] Define the interface for training callbacks (e.g., `CallbackBase` class).
*   - [‚úÖ] Implement common callbacks:
    *   - [‚úÖ] Logging callback (for console and/or file).
    *   - [‚úÖ] Model checkpointing callback.
    *   - [‚úÖ] Early stopping callback (optional, based on a monitored metric).
*   - [‚úÖ] Integrate metrics collection within the training loop.
*   - [‚úÖ] Ensure the engine can handle different model types provided by the `ModelFactory`.
*   - [‚úÖ] Implement logic for saving and loading training state for resumption.
*   - [‚úÖ] Write unit tests, including tests for callback interactions and checkpointing/resuming.

## Implementation Summary üìù

Successfully implemented the Training Engine Core with the following components:

1. **TrainingEngine** (`src/training/engine.py`):
   - Main training loop management
   - Integration with ModelFactory for model creation
   - Integration with DataManager for data loading
   - Support for checkpoint/resume functionality
   - Comprehensive error handling and state management

2. **Callback System** (`src/training/callbacks.py`):
   - `CallbackBase`: Abstract base class for all callbacks
   - `CallbackList`: Container for managing multiple callbacks
   - `LoggingCallback`: Logs training progress to console/file
   - `ModelCheckpointCallback`: Saves model checkpoints with optional registry integration
   - `EarlyStoppingCallback`: Stops training based on metric monitoring

3. **Features Implemented**:
   - Flexible training configuration
   - Automatic default callbacks (logging, checkpointing)
   - Training history tracking
   - Metrics collection and aggregation
   - Support for validation data
   - Integration with artifact storage for model versioning

4. **Testing**:
   - Comprehensive unit tests for callbacks (`tests/unit/test_training_callbacks.py`)
   - Comprehensive unit tests for training engine (`tests/unit/test_training_engine.py`)
   - Example usage scripts (`examples/training_engine_example.py`)

The implementation provides a robust foundation for training machine learning models with full support for monitoring, checkpointing, and resumption.
