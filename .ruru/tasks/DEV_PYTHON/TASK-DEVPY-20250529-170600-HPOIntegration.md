# Implement Task 4.4: Hyperparameter Optimization Integration

## Description ✍️

*   **What is this feature?** This task is to implement **Task 4.4: Hyperparameter Optimization Integration** as defined in the Model Pipeline Implementation Plan ([`.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md`](.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md:225)). The objective is to integrate hyperparameter optimization (HPO) capabilities, likely using Ray Tune, into the new ML pipeline.
*   **Why is it needed?** To automate the process of finding optimal hyperparameters for models, improving model performance and reducing manual tuning efforts.
*   **Scope (from Implementation Plan - Task 4.4):**
    *   Implement an `HPOptimizer` class, potentially wrapping Ray Tune.
    *   Define a system for search space configuration.
    *   Implement trial management and tracking.
    *   Provide tools for analyzing HPO results.
*   **Links:**
    *   Project Plan: [`.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md#task-44-hyperparameter-optimization-integration`](.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md:225)
    *   Training Engine Core Task (Dependency): [`.ruru/tasks/DEV_PYTHON/TASK-DEVPY-20250529-152800-TrainingEngineCore.md`](.ruru/tasks/DEV_PYTHON/TASK-DEVPY-20250529-152800-TrainingEngineCore.md)

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

(Derived from Implementation Plan - Task 4.4 Deliverables & Details)
*   - [✅] An `HPOptimizer` class is implemented, integrating with a chosen HPO library (e.g., Ray Tune, Optuna).
*   - [✅] The system allows defining search spaces for hyperparameters for different models.
*   - [✅] The `HPOptimizer` integrates with the `TrainingEngine` to run training trials with different hyperparameter configurations.
*   - [✅] Trial management is implemented, including starting, stopping, and tracking the status of HPO trials.
*   - [✅] Results from HPO runs (e.g., best hyperparameters, performance metrics for each trial) are collected and can be easily analyzed.
*   - [✅] The system supports different search algorithms and schedulers provided by the HPO library.
*   - [✅] Unit tests are provided for the `HPOptimizer` and its integration points.
*   - [✅] An example script demonstrating HPO usage is created.

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks 📝

*   - [✅] Research and select/confirm the HPO library (Ray Tune is suggested in the plan).
*   - [✅] Design the `HPOptimizer` class and its interface.
*   - [✅] Implement the integration with the `TrainingEngine`, ensuring the engine can be called with varying hyperparameter sets.
*   - [✅] Develop a way to define and parse search space configurations (e.g., from YAML or Python dicts).
*   - [✅] Implement trial execution logic, including parallel trial execution if supported by the library.
*   - [✅] Implement results collection and storage (potentially using `ArtifactStore` or HPO library's native capabilities).
*   - [✅] Create utility functions or classes for analyzing HPO results (e.g., finding best trial, plotting performance).
*   - [✅] Write unit tests, focusing on the `HPOptimizer`'s logic and its interaction with the `TrainingEngine`.
*   - [✅] Create an example script in `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/examples/` demonstrating HPO.
