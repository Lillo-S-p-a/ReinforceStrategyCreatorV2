# Implement Task 1.4: Artifact Store Implementation

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

*   **What is this feature?**
    This task is to implement **Task 1.4: Artifact Store Implementation** as defined in the Model Pipeline Implementation Plan ([`.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md`](.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md:90)).
    The objective is to create a system for storing and versioning artifacts produced by the model pipeline (e.g., datasets, models, evaluation reports).
*   **Why is it needed?**
    An artifact store is crucial for reproducibility, tracking experiment lineage, and managing pipeline outputs.
*   **Scope (from Implementation Plan - Task 1.4):**
    *   Implement an `ArtifactStore` base class/interface.
    *   Create a local file system storage adapter for the `ArtifactStore`.
    *   Implement basic versioning capabilities for artifacts.
    *   Define a structure for storing artifact metadata.
*   **Links:**
    *   Implementation Plan: [`.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md#task-14-artifact-store-implementation`](.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md#task-14-artifact-store-implementation)
    *   Architecture Document: (Refer to relevant sections, e.g., on artifact management)

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

(Derived from Implementation Plan - Task 1.4 Deliverables)
*   - [‚úÖ] An `ArtifactStore` base class or interface is defined (e.g., in `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/artifact_store/base.py`).
*   - [‚úÖ] A local file system adapter implementing the `ArtifactStore` interface is created (e.g., `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/artifact_store/local_adapter.py`).
*   - [‚úÖ] The system supports saving artifacts (e.g., files, directories) to the store.
*   - [‚úÖ] The system supports retrieving artifacts from the store.
*   - [‚úÖ] Basic artifact versioning is implemented (e.g., storing multiple versions of an artifact, retrieving a specific version).
*   - [‚úÖ] A mechanism for storing and retrieving metadata associated with each artifact version is in place (e.g., using JSON files or a simple database).
*   - [‚úÖ] Unit tests are provided for the `ArtifactStore` and its local adapter.

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks üìù

*   Define the `ArtifactStore` interface with methods like `save_artifact`, `load_artifact`, `list_artifacts`, `get_artifact_metadata`, etc.
*   For the local file system adapter, decide on a directory structure for storing artifacts and their versions (e.g., `artifacts_root/[artifact_name]/[version]/data` and `artifacts_root/[artifact_name]/[version]/metadata.json`).
*   Consider how artifact names and versions will be handled.
*   Implement metadata storage (e.g., creation date, source, parameters used to generate it).
*   Ensure the artifact store can handle different types of artifacts (e.g., model files, datasets, images, reports).
*   The artifact store should be configurable via the `ConfigManager` (e.g., setting the root path for the local store).

## Log Entries ü™µ
