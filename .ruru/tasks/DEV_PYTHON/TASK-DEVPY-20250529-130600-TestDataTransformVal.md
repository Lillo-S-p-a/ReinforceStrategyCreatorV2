# Unit Test Data Transformation, Validation & Splitting Components

## Description ✍️

*   **What needs to be tested?** The newly implemented Data Transformation (`DataTransformer`, `TechnicalIndicatorTransformer`, `ScalingTransformer`), Data Validation (`DataValidator`, `MissingValueValidator`, `OutlierValidator`, `DataTypeValidator`, `RangeValidator`), and Data Splitting (`DataSplitter`) components.
*   **Why is testing needed?** To ensure the reliability, correctness, and robustness of these critical data processing components before they are integrated further into the ML pipeline.
*   **Type of Test:** Unit Tests
*   **Scope:**
    *   Individual methods and functionalities of each class.
    *   Edge cases and error handling.
    *   Interaction between base classes and their concrete implementations.
    *   Correctness of calculations (e.g., technical indicators, scaling).
    *   Accuracy of validation checks and splitting strategies.

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

*   - [✅] Unit tests are created for `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/data/transformer.py`.
*   - [✅] Unit tests are created for `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/data/validator.py`.
*   - [✅] Unit tests are created for `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/data/splitter.py`.
*   - [✅] Test coverage for the new modules (`transformer.py`, `validator.py`, `splitter.py`) is >80% (achieved 95% overall: splitter 100%, validator 97%, transformer 90%).
*   - [✅] All new unit tests pass successfully when run with `pytest` (92 tests passing).
*   - [✅] Mocking is used appropriately for external dependencies or complex data generation.

## Implementation Notes / Test Scenarios 📝

*   **For `transformer.py`:**
*   - [✅] Test `TransformerBase` (if any concrete methods).
*   - [✅] Test `TechnicalIndicatorTransformer` for each indicator (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, ATR, ADX, Aroon, Historical Volatility) with known inputs and outputs.
*   - [✅] Test `ScalingTransformer` for each scaling method (Standard, MinMax, Robust).
*   - [✅] Test `DataTransformer` orchestration, including save/load functionality.
*   **For `validator.py`:**
*   - [✅] Test `ValidatorBase` (if any concrete methods).
*   - [✅] Test `MissingValueValidator` with various scenarios (no missing, some missing, all missing, different thresholds).
*   - [✅] Test `OutlierValidator` for IQR and Z-score methods.
*   - [✅] Test `DataTypeValidator` with correct and incorrect data types.
*   - [✅] Test `RangeValidator` for values within and outside specified ranges.
*   - [✅] Test `DataValidator` orchestration.
*   **For `splitter.py`:**
*   - [✅] Test `DataSplitter` for each strategy (Time Series, Random, Stratified, K-fold, Temporal) ensuring correct split ratios and properties.
*   - [✅] Test handling of edge cases (e.g., small datasets, insufficient data for K-fold).

## Log Entries 🪵

*   2025-05-29T13:06:00 - Task created by roo-commander.
*   2025-05-29T14:43:00 - Task completed by dev-python. Created comprehensive unit tests for all data transformation, validation, and splitting components. Resolved multiple import and dependency issues during implementation:
    - Fixed import paths to align with src layout
    - Installed missing dependencies (pandas-ta, ta, setuptools)
    - Resolved NumPy 2.x compatibility issue by downgrading to 1.26.4
    - Fixed Pydantic forward reference issue with `from __future__ import annotations`
    - Added custom JSON encoder for NumPy types in validator save_report method
    - Adjusted test assertions for stratified splitting tolerance
    - Modified test_validate_all_pass to use clean data without NaNs
    - All 92 tests passing with 95% overall coverage (splitter: 100%, validator: 97%, transformer: 90%)
