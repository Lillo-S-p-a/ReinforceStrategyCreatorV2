## üìù Description

The end-to-end pipeline is now running, but we need to explicitly verify that the model artifact persistence mechanism is working correctly between the `TrainingStage` and `EvaluationStage`.

This involves:
1.  Ensuring the `TrainingStage` uses `self.artifact_store.save_artifact()` to save the trained model and correctly returns/sets the `artifact_id`.
2.  Ensuring this `artifact_id` (as `trained_model_artifact_id`) is placed into the `PipelineContext`.
3.  Ensuring the `EvaluationStage` retrieves this `trained_model_artifact_id` from the context.
4.  Ensuring the `EvaluationStage` uses `self.artifact_store.load_artifact()` with this ID to load the model for evaluation.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

*   The `TrainingStage._save_model_artifact()` method correctly uses `self.artifact_store.save_artifact()` and ensures the returned artifact ID is stored as `trained_model_artifact_id` in the `PipelineContext`.
*   The `EvaluationStage` (likely in its `setup()` or `run()` method, specifically where `self.evaluation_engine` loads the model) successfully retrieves `trained_model_artifact_id` from the context.
*   The `EvaluationStage` successfully uses `self.artifact_store.load_artifact(trained_model_artifact_id)` to load the model.
*   Logging is added/enhanced in both stages to clearly show:
    *   `TrainingStage`: Path where the temporary model is saved before artifacting, the artifact ID generated, and confirmation of setting it in context.
    *   `EvaluationStage`: The retrieved `trained_model_artifact_id`, and confirmation of successful model loading from the artifact store (or the path it was loaded to).
*   The physical model artifact exists in the configured artifact store location (e.g., `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/artifacts/models/`) after the `TrainingStage` completes.
*   The pipeline runs successfully through the `EvaluationStage` using the loaded model (it may still use simulated metrics for now, but the model loading part must work).

## üìã Checklist

*   [‚úÖ] **Review and Modify `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/pipeline/stages/training.py`**:
    *   In `_save_model_artifact()`:
        *   Confirm `self.artifact_store.save_artifact(artifact_path_to_save, "model", metadata)` is called.
        *   Ensure the `artifact_id` returned by `save_artifact` is correctly assigned to `self.trained_model_artifact_id`.
        *   Ensure `self.context.set("trained_model_artifact_id", self.trained_model_artifact_id)` is called.
    *   Add detailed logging for artifact ID and context setting.
*   [‚úÖ] **Review and Modify `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/pipeline/stages/evaluation.py`**:
    *   In `setup()` or `run()` where the model is prepared for `EvaluationEngine`:
        *   Retrieve `trained_model_artifact_id = self.context.get("trained_model_artifact_id")`.
        *   Add a check: if `trained_model_artifact_id` is `None`, log an error and potentially raise an exception (as this is critical).
        *   Load the model: `loaded_model_path_or_object = self.artifact_store.load_artifact(trained_model_artifact_id)`.
        *   Ensure `self.evaluation_engine` is then configured to use this loaded model (the `EvaluationEngine`'s `load_model_from_artifact_id` or similar method should handle the actual loading via artifact store).
    *   Add detailed logging for retrieving artifact ID and model loading.
*   [ ] **Verify `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/evaluation/engine.py`**:
    *   Ensure `EvaluationEngine.evaluate()` or its model loading mechanism correctly uses `self.artifact_store.load_artifact(model_artifact_id)` if it's responsible for loading.
*   [ ] **Run Pipeline**: Execute `python run_main_pipeline.py` from the `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline` directory.
*   [ ] **Check Logs**: Verify the new logging confirms the artifact ID flow and successful save/load.
*   [ ] **Check Artifact Store**: Manually inspect the `artifacts/models/` directory (or as configured) to confirm the model artifact file/directory exists and seems reasonable.
