# Implement Task 1.3: Logging & Monitoring Foundation

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

*   **What is this feature?**
    This task is to implement **Task 1.3: Logging & Monitoring Foundation** as defined in the Model Pipeline Implementation Plan ([`.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md`](.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md:75)).
    The objective is to set up centralized logging and the foundational structure for monitoring within the `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline` project.
*   **Why is it needed?**
    Robust logging and monitoring are essential for debugging, tracking pipeline execution, and ensuring operational stability.
*   **Scope (from Implementation Plan - Task 1.3):**
    *   Set up logging configuration and utilities.
    *   Define a basic monitoring service structure.
    *   Integrate with Datadog.
*   **Links:**
    *   Implementation Plan: [`.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md#task-13-logging--monitoring-foundation`](.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md#task-13-logging--monitoring-foundation)
    *   Architecture Document: (Refer to relevant sections if any, e.g., on observability)

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

(Derived from Implementation Plan - Task 1.3 Deliverables)
*   - [‚úÖ] Logging is configured for the `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline` project, supporting structured logging with appropriate levels (e.g., INFO, WARNING, ERROR).
*   - [‚úÖ] Logging utilities are available for easy use within pipeline components.
*   - [‚úÖ] A basic structure for a monitoring service/module is defined (e.g., `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/monitoring/`).
*   - [‚úÖ] Initial Datadog integration is set up (e.g., client initialization, ability to send basic metrics or logs).
*   - [‚úÖ] Configuration for logging (e.g., log level, format, Datadog API key) is manageable via the `ConfigManager`.

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks üìù

*   Choose a suitable Python logging library (e.g., standard `logging`, `loguru`).
*   Implement structured logging (e.g., JSON format) to facilitate log aggregation and analysis.
*   Define how log configuration will be managed (e.g., via `pipeline.yaml`).
*   Set up Datadog client and ensure API key can be securely provided (e.g., via environment variable referenced in config).
*   Create examples or simple utilities for sending custom metrics to Datadog.
*   Consider basic health check endpoints or mechanisms if applicable for the monitoring service.
*   Consult with `infra-specialist` for Datadog best practices and setup.
