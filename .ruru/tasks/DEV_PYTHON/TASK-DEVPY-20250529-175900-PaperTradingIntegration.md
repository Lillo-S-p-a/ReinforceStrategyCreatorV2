# Implement Task 6.2: Paper Trading Integration

## Description ✍️

*   **What is this feature?** This task is to implement **Task 6.2: Paper Trading Integration** as defined in the Model Pipeline Implementation Plan ([`.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md`](.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md:293)). The objective is to deploy models to a paper trading environment for simulated live performance evaluation.
*   **Why is it needed?** To assess model performance under realistic (simulated) market conditions without risking real capital, providing a crucial step before live deployment.
*   **Scope (from Implementation Plan - Task 6.2):**
    *   Implement a `PaperTradingDeployer` class or module.
    *   Develop or integrate a trading simulation engine.
    *   Implement performance tracking for paper trades.
    *   Incorporate basic risk management features.
*   **Links:**
    *   Project Plan: [`.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md#task-62-paper-trading-integration`](.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md:293)
    *   Deployment Manager (Dependency): [`.ruru/tasks/DEV_PYTHON/TASK-DEVPY-20250529-174800-DeploymentManager.md`](.ruru/tasks/DEV_PYTHON/TASK-DEVPY-20250529-174800-DeploymentManager.md)

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

(Derived from Implementation Plan - Task 6.2 Deliverables & Details)
*   - [✅] A `PaperTradingDeployer` class (or equivalent module/functions) is implemented to manage paper trading deployments.
*   - [✅] A trading simulation engine is developed or integrated to process market data and execute simulated trades.
*   - [✅] Performance of paper trades (e.g., P&L, drawdown, Sharpe ratio) is tracked and can be reported.
*   - [✅] Basic risk management features (e.g., stop-loss, position limits) are implemented within the simulation.
*   - [✅] The `PaperTradingDeployer` integrates with the `DeploymentManager` for deploying models to the paper trading environment.
*   - [✅] Unit tests are provided for the `PaperTradingDeployer` and simulation components.
*   - [✅] An example script demonstrating the setup and execution of a paper trading session is created in `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/examples/`.

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks 📝

*   - [✅] Design the `PaperTradingDeployer` interface and its interaction with the `DeploymentManager`.
*   - [✅] Define the requirements for the trading simulation engine:
    *   - [✅] Ability to consume real-time or simulated market data feeds.
    *   - [✅] Order execution logic (simulated fills, slippage considerations if applicable).
    *   - [✅] Portfolio state management (positions, cash).
*   - [✅] Implement or select a suitable trading simulation library/framework if available, or build a lightweight one.
*   - [✅] Implement performance tracking metrics specific to trading (e.g., P&L, win/loss ratio, max drawdown).
*   - [✅] Implement basic risk management rules (e.g., max position size, daily stop-loss).
*   - [✅] Develop logic for the `PaperTradingDeployer` to set up the paper trading environment, load the deployed model, and start the simulation.
*   - [✅] Ensure that results from paper trading can be fed back into the evaluation and reporting system (Task 5.1, 5.2).
*   - [✅] Write unit tests for all new components.
*   - [✅] Create an example script in `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/examples/` demonstrating a paper trading session.
