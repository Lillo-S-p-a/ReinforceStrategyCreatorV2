# Implement Task 1.2: Configuration Management System

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

*   **What is this feature?**
    This task is to implement **Task 1.2: Configuration Management System** as defined in the Model Pipeline Implementation Plan ([`.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md`](.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md)).
    The objective is to create a robust and hierarchical configuration management system for the new model pipeline, located within the `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline` project.
*   **Why is it needed?**
    A flexible configuration system is crucial for managing pipeline parameters, environment-specific settings, and experiments.
*   **Scope (from Implementation Plan - Task 1.2):**
    *   Implement `ConfigManager` class.
    *   Implement `ConfigLoader` with YAML file support.
    *   Implement `ConfigValidator` using Pydantic models for configuration validation.
    *   Create base configuration templates (e.g., for pipeline, data, models).
    *   Support for environment-specific overrides (e.g., development, staging, production).
    *   Support for environment variable substitution in configuration files.
*   **Links:**
    *   Implementation Plan: [`.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md#task-12-configuration-management-system`](.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md#task-12-configuration-management-system)
    *   Architecture Document: [`.ruru/docs/architecture/model_pipeline_v1_architecture.md#48-configuration-manager`](.ruru/docs/architecture/model_pipeline_v1_architecture.md#48-configuration-manager)

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

(Derived from Implementation Plan - Task 1.2 Deliverables)
*   - [‚úÖ] `ConfigManager` class is implemented in `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/config/manager.py`.
*   - [‚úÖ] `ConfigLoader` class is implemented in `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/config/loader.py` and supports loading configurations from YAML files.
*   - [‚úÖ] `ConfigValidator` class is implemented in `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/config/validator.py` and uses Pydantic models for validating loaded configurations.
*   - [‚úÖ] Base configuration templates (e.g., `pipeline.yaml`, `data.yaml`, `models.yaml`) are created in `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/configs/base/`.
*   - [‚úÖ] The system supports overriding base configurations with environment-specific configurations (e.g., from `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/configs/environments/development.yaml`).
*   - [‚úÖ] The system supports substituting environment variables (e.g., `${API_KEY}`) within YAML configuration files.
*   - [‚úÖ] Unit tests are provided for `ConfigManager`, `ConfigLoader`, and `ConfigValidator`.

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks üìù

*   - [‚úÖ] Design Pydantic models for each configuration section (pipeline, data, models, training, evaluation, deployment).
*   - [‚úÖ] Implement YAML loading logic, potentially using a library like `PyYAML`.
*   - [‚úÖ] Implement logic for merging base and environment-specific configurations.
*   - [‚úÖ] Implement environment variable substitution (e.g., using `os.path.expandvars` or a similar mechanism).
*   - [‚úÖ] Ensure clear error handling for invalid configurations or missing files.
*   - [‚úÖ] Place the core logic in `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/config/`.

## Summary

Successfully implemented a robust configuration management system for the model pipeline with the following features:

1. **Hierarchical Configuration**: Base configurations can be overridden by environment-specific settings
2. **Environment Variable Support**: Configurations support `${VAR_NAME}` substitution with optional defaults
3. **Strong Validation**: Pydantic models ensure type safety and validation with clear error messages
4. **Multiple Environments**: Pre-configured for development, staging, and production environments
5. **Comprehensive Templates**: Base templates for pipeline, data, and model configurations
6. **Well-Tested**: Unit tests cover all major functionality with good edge case coverage

The configuration system is now ready to be used by other pipeline components for managing their settings in a consistent and validated manner.
