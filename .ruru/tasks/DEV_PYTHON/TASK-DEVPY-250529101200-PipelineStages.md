# Implement Task 2.2: Pipeline Stage Implementations

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

*   **What is this feature?**
    This task is to implement **Task 2.2: Pipeline Stage Implementations** as defined in the Model Pipeline Implementation Plan ([`.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md`](.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md:124)).
    The objective is to create concrete implementations of the various pipeline stages, building upon the `PipelineStage` abstract base class developed in Task 2.1.
*   **Why is it needed?**
    These stage implementations form the core functional units of the model pipeline, handling specific data processing, training, and evaluation steps.
*   **Scope (from Implementation Plan - Task 2.2):**
    *   Implement a Data Ingestion stage.
    *   Implement a Feature Engineering stage.
    *   Implement a Training stage.
    *   Implement an Evaluation stage.
    *   Implement a Deployment stage.
*   **Links:**
    *   Implementation Plan: [`.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md#task-22-pipeline-stage-implementations`](.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md#task-22-pipeline-stage-implementations)
    *   Architecture Document: (Refer to relevant sections on pipeline stages)
    *   Orchestrator Core Task: [`.ruru/tasks/UTIL_SENIOR_DEV/TASK-SRDEV-250529100300-OrchestratorCore.md`](.ruru/tasks/UTIL_SENIOR_DEV/TASK-SRDEV-250529100300-OrchestratorCore.md)

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

(Derived from Implementation Plan - Task 2.2 Deliverables)
*   - [‚úÖ] A concrete `DataIngestionStage` class is implemented, inheriting from `PipelineStage`.
*   - [‚úÖ] A concrete `FeatureEngineeringStage` class is implemented, inheriting from `PipelineStage`.
*   - [‚úÖ] A concrete `TrainingStage` class is implemented, inheriting from `PipelineStage`.
*   - [‚úÖ] A concrete `EvaluationStage` class is implemented, inheriting from `PipelineStage`.
*   - [‚úÖ] A concrete `DeploymentStage` class is implemented, inheriting from `PipelineStage`.
*   - [‚úÖ] Each stage correctly implements the abstract methods defined in `PipelineStage` (e.g., `run(context: PipelineContext)`).
*   - [‚úÖ] Each stage handles its specific configuration using the `ConfigManager` and `PipelineContext`.
*   - [‚úÖ] Inter-stage data passing is handled correctly via `PipelineContext` and/or the `ArtifactStore`.
*   - [‚úÖ] Stage-level error handling is implemented.
*   - [‚úÖ] Unit tests are provided for each implemented pipeline stage.

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks üìù

*   Create a new directory for stage implementations, e.g., `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/pipeline/stages/`.
*   For each stage:
    *   Define its specific inputs, outputs, and configuration parameters.
    *   Implement the core logic of the stage.
    *   Integrate with other services (ConfigManager, Logger, ArtifactStore) as needed.
    *   Ensure clear logging of stage progress and outcomes.
*   Consider creating base classes for common stage types if patterns emerge (e.g., `DataProcessingStage`, `ModelLifecycleStage`).
