# Implement Task 3.1: Data Manager Core

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

*   **What is this feature?**
    This task is to implement **Task 3.1: Data Manager Core** as defined in the Model Pipeline Implementation Plan ([`.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md`](.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md:143)).
    The objective is to implement the data management system for the pipeline.
*   **Why is it needed?**
    This system will handle multi-source data ingestion, caching, versioning, and lineage.
*   **Scope (from Implementation Plan - Task 3.1):**
    *   Implement `DataManager` main class.
    *   Implement `DataSource` abstract interface.
    *   Implement CSV and API data source implementations.
    *   Implement data versioning capabilities.
*   **Links:**
    *   Implementation Plan: [`.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md#task-31-data-manager-core`](.ruru/planning/model_pipeline_implementation_plan_v1.md#task-31-data-manager-core)
    *   Architecture Document: (Refer to relevant sections on data management)

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

(Derived from Implementation Plan - Task 3.1 Deliverables)
*   - [‚úÖ] A `DataManager` main class is implemented.
*   - [‚úÖ] A `DataSource` abstract interface is defined.
*   - [‚úÖ] Concrete `CsvDataSource` and `ApiDataSource` classes are implemented, inheriting from `DataSource`.
*   - [‚úÖ] Data versioning capabilities are implemented within the `DataManager` or related components.
*   - [‚úÖ] The `DataManager` supports multi-source data ingestion.
*   - [‚úÖ] Basic data caching mechanisms are implemented.
*   - [‚úÖ] Data lineage recording (e.g., source, version, transformations applied) is considered and a basic structure is in place.
*   - [‚úÖ] Unit tests are provided for the `DataManager` and `DataSource` implementations.

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks üìù

*   Create a new directory for data management components, e.g., `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/src/data/`.
*   Define the `DataSource` interface with methods like `load_data()`, `get_schema()`, etc.
*   Implement `CsvDataSource` to read data from CSV files.
*   Implement `ApiDataSource` to fetch data from a configurable API endpoint (consider a mock API for testing).
*   The `DataManager` should orchestrate data loading from different sources, manage versions, and handle caching.
*   Consider how data versions will be identified and stored (e.g., using the `ArtifactStore`).
*   For lineage, think about what information needs to be tracked for each dataset.
