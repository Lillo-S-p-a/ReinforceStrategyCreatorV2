# Analyze and Fix Pytest Failures in reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline

## Description ✍️

*   **What is the problem?**
    A significant number of `pytest` tests (135 failed, 15 errors) are failing in the `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline` module after setting up the development environment and running the test suite.
*   **Where does it occur?**
    Within the `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/tests/` directory when running `pytest tests/`.
*   **Impact:**
    High. The pipeline's stability and correctness cannot be assured with this many test failures. This blocks further development and testing of the pipeline.

## Steps to Reproduce 🚶‍♀️

1.  Set up the development environment for `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline` (create venv, install editable with dev dependencies).
2.  Navigate to the `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline` directory.
3.  Run the command `pytest tests/`.
4.  Observe the test output, noting the large number of failures and errors. The full output is available at `.ruru/sessions/SESSION-TestModelTrainingPipelineAndAnalyzeNextSteps-2506040958/artifacts/docs/pytest_output_2506041009.txt`.

## Expected Behavior ✅

*   The `pytest` test suite should pass with minimal or zero failures, indicating a stable and correctly functioning pipeline module.

## Actual Behavior ❌

*   The `pytest` execution completed with 135 failed tests and 15 errors.
*   Specific error messages vary, including `RuntimeError: ConfigManager not found`, `TypeError`, `AttributeError`, `FileNotFoundError`, `AssertionError`, and `OSError`.
*   The full list of failures and errors can be found in the linked `pytest_output_2506041009.txt` file.

## Environment Details 🖥️ (Optional - Use if not in TOML)

*   **OS:** Linux (as per `environment_details`)
*   **Python Version:** 3.12.3 (from `pytest` output)
*   **`pytest` Version:** 8.3.5 (from `pytest` output)
*   **App Version/Commit:** Not specified, assume latest from workspace.

## Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done) ✅

*   - [ ] All 135 failed tests in `reinforcestrategycreator_pipeline/tests/` are passing.
*   - [ ] All 15 errors reported by `pytest` are resolved.
*   - [ ] The root cause(s) for the failures and errors have been identified and documented in this task.
*   - [ ] Fixes are implemented in a way that does not introduce new issues.
*   - [ ] (Optional) Regression tests are added for any non-obvious fixes if applicable.
