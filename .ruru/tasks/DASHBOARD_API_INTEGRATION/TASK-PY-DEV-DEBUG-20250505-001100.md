# Debug Streamlit Dashboard API Connection Failure

## üìù Description

Following the integration task (`TASK-PY-DEV-20250504-103500.md`), the Streamlit dashboard (`dashboard.py`) is displaying errors indicating it cannot fetch data from the FastAPI metrics API.

**Observed Errors (from screenshot):**
*   "Could not fetch latest training run."
*   "Failed to fetch initial run data. Cannot display dashboard."

This task requires debugging the connection and data fetching logic within `dashboard.py` to resolve these errors.

**API Details (Reminder):**
*   Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/`
*   Authentication: `X-API-Key` header.
*   Development Key: `test-key-123`

## üîç Investigation Areas

*   **API Availability:** Ensure the FastAPI server is running and accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
*   **Endpoint Paths:** Double-check the exact API endpoint paths being called in `dashboard.py` against the actual routes defined in the FastAPI application (`reinforcestrategycreator/api/`).
*   **API Key Header:** Verify that the `X-API-Key: test-key-123` header is correctly included in *all* requests made from `dashboard.py`.
*   **Request Logic:** Examine the `requests` (or equivalent) calls in `dashboard.py`. Are they constructed correctly?
*   **Response Handling:** How is the API response being processed? Are status codes being checked? Is the JSON parsing correct?
*   **Error Handling:** Review the error handling logic implemented in the previous task. Is it catching the specific errors occurring, and can it provide more detailed logs or messages? Add more specific logging around the API calls to pinpoint the failure.
*   **Data Structure:** Ensure the dashboard expects the data structure exactly as the API provides it.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

*   The errors "Could not fetch latest training run" and "Failed to fetch initial run data" are no longer displayed when running the dashboard (`streamlit run dashboard.py`) while the FastAPI server is active.
*   The dashboard successfully fetches data from the API and displays the relevant visualizations correctly.
*   The root cause of the connection failure is identified and fixed in `dashboard.py`.
*   Any necessary improvements to error logging or handling are implemented.

## üìã Checklist

- [x] Verify the FastAPI server is running and accessible locally. (Switched to port 8001 due to port conflict)
- [x] Add detailed logging around API calls in `dashboard.py` (endpoint, headers, status code, response snippet).
- [x] Run `streamlit run dashboard.py` and examine the logs/terminal output for specific errors related to the API calls. (Identified connection refused, missing .env vars, uninitialized DB)
- [x] Systematically check API endpoint paths used in the dashboard against the FastAPI routes. (Paths were correct)
- [x] Confirm the `X-API-Key` header is correctly formatted and sent with every request. (Dashboard sends key correctly; server-side config fixed via .env)
- [x] Analyze the response handling and JSON parsing logic for potential issues. (Logic handles empty data correctly)
- [x] Implement necessary fixes in `dashboard.py`. (Updated API port to 8001) - Also coordinated fixes for backend issues (.env creation/update, DB initialization).
- [x] Test the dashboard again to confirm the errors are resolved and data is displayed. (Connection errors resolved; dashboard displays expected 'no data' state accurately reflecting the empty DB).
- [x] Update this task file status (`status = "üü¢ Done"`) and checklist upon completion.
