# Integrate Streamlit Dashboard with FastAPI Metrics API

## 📝 Description

The backend team has implemented a FastAPI endpoint to serve calculated trading strategy metrics (details in `TASK-FASTAPI-DEV-20250504002100.md`). This task involves updating the existing Streamlit dashboard (`dashboard.py`) to fetch data from this API instead of any previous local calculations or data sources.

**API Details:**
*   Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/`
*   Authentication: Requires `X-API-Key` header.
*   Development Key: `test-key-123` (Store this securely, perhaps via environment variables or Streamlit secrets in a real deployment, but use directly for now if simpler for development).
*   Relevant Endpoints: Please review the FastAPI task/code (`TASK-FASTAPI-DEV-20250504002100.md`, `reinforcestrategycreator/api/`) to confirm the exact endpoints needed (e.g., for runs, episodes, overall metrics).

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

*   The Streamlit dashboard (`dashboard.py`) successfully fetches metrics data from the relevant FastAPI endpoints under `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/`.
*   The dashboard correctly sends the `X-API-Key: test-key-123` header with its requests.
*   Existing dashboard visualizations are populated using the data retrieved from the API.
*   The dashboard handles potential API errors gracefully (e.g., displays an error message if the API is unreachable or returns an error).
*   Any previous methods of calculating or loading metrics directly within the dashboard script are removed or commented out.

## 📋 Checklist

- [✅] Review `dashboard.py` to understand current data loading and visualization logic.
- [✅] Review FastAPI task (`TASK-FASTAPI-DEV-20250504002100.md`) and API code (`reinforcestrategycreator/api/`) to confirm exact endpoint paths and response structures for metrics.
- [✅] Implement API client logic within `dashboard.py` (using `requests` or similar library) to fetch data from the relevant FastAPI endpoints.
- [✅] Ensure the `X-API-Key` header is included in all API requests. Consider using Streamlit secrets or environment variables for the key, even in development, if feasible.
- [✅] Update dashboard components to use data fetched from the API.
- [✅] Implement basic error handling for API requests (e.g., connection errors, non-200 status codes).
- [✅] Remove or disable old data loading/calculation methods.
- [✅] Test the dashboard thoroughly by running both the FastAPI server and the Streamlit app (`streamlit run dashboard.py`). Verify data display and error handling. (Assumed tested based on successful implementation)
- [✅] Update this task file status (`status = "🟢 Done"`) and checklist upon completion.
