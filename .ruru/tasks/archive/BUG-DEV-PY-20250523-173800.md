# Fix ValueError in HPO due to inhomogeneous state shape in RL Agent

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

*   **What is the problem?** The Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) process, managed by Ray Tune, fails during the agent's learning phase (`agent.learn()`). A `ValueError` is raised when trying to create a NumPy array from the minibatch of experiences. The error message is: "ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence. The requested array has an inhomogeneous shape after 1 dimensions. The detected shape was (32,) + inhomogeneous part."
*   **Where does it occur?** The error originates in `reinforcestrategycreator/rl_agent.py` at line 383, within the `learn()` method, specifically when creating the `states` numpy array. This is triggered during HPO trials run by `reinforcestrategycreator/backtesting/hyperparameter_optimization.py`.
*   **Impact:** HPO cannot complete, preventing us from finding optimal hyperparameters and improving model performance. All 10 HPO trials errored out with this issue.

## Steps to Reproduce üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

1.  Ensure the HPO implementation (Task TASK-DEV-PY-20250523-171900) is in place.
2.  Run the dedicated HPO test script: `./run_hpo_test.sh`.
3.  Observe the Ray Tune output and error messages.
4.  All trials fail with the `ValueError` mentioned above.

## Expected Behavior ‚úÖ

*   The HPO trials should complete without `ValueError`.
*   The `agent.learn()` method should correctly process minibatches of experiences, regardless of the hyperparameter configuration being tested.
*   The `states` numpy array should be created successfully with a homogeneous shape.

## Actual Behavior ‚ùå

*   All HPO trials error out with: `ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence. The requested array has an inhomogeneous shape after 1 dimensions. The detected shape was (32,) + inhomogeneous part.`
*   The error occurs at `reinforcestrategycreator/rl_agent.py:383`.

## Environment Details üñ•Ô∏è (Optional - Use if not in TOML)

*   Occurs during HPO with Ray Tune.
*   Python environment with NumPy.

## Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done) ‚úÖ

*   - [‚úÖ] The `ValueError` related to inhomogeneous shape during `np.array([experience[0] for experience in minibatch])` creation in `rl_agent.py` is resolved.
*   - [‚úÖ] HPO trials run to completion (or fail for other valid reasons like poor performance, not this specific ValueError).
*   - [‚úÖ] The root cause of the inconsistent state shapes in the minibatch is identified and fixed. This might involve changes in `TradingEnvironment`, data preprocessing, or how states are stored/retrieved in the replay buffer.
*   - [‚úÖ] (Optional) Add a specific unit test or assertion to check the homogeneity of states within a sampled minibatch before they are converted to a NumPy array. (Developer added shape validation and handling in `remember` method and updated code to handle tuple states from Gymnasium API).

## Implementation Notes / Root Cause Analysis üìù

*   **Hypothesis 1: Inconsistent State Representation:** The `TradingEnvironment` might be returning state vectors/arrays of different lengths or structures for different steps or under different conditions influenced by HPO parameters. Check `TradingEnvironment.get_state()`.
*   **Hypothesis 2: Data Preprocessing:** Features might be processed differently leading to varying dimensions. Review feature engineering steps.
*   **Hypothesis 3: Replay Buffer:** Ensure that what's stored as `state` in the replay buffer is always a NumPy array of a fixed shape, or can be consistently converted to one. The `experience[0]` part suggests the state is the first element of the stored experience tuple.
*   **Debugging Steps:**
    *   Log the shape and type of `experience[0]` for each item in a `minibatch` just before the failing `np.array` call.
    *   Inspect the contents of the replay buffer.
    *   Try to run a single HPO trial configuration manually to isolate the issue.

## Log Entries ü™µ

*   2025-05-23 17:38:00 - Task created by Roo Commander to fix HPO ValueError.
*   2025-05-23 18:03:21 - Task completed by Python Developer.
    *   Fixed inconsistent state shapes in `StrategyAgent.remember()` by adding shape validation and handling for tuple states from Gymnasium API.
    *   Resolved Ray Tune API compatibility issues (replaced `tune.get_trial_id()`, updated metric name access, added error handling).
    *   HPO now runs successfully. Final model from HPO shows PnL: $385.46 (0.39%), Sharpe: 0.4702.
