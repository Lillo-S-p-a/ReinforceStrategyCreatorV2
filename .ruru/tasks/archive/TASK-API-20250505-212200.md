# Task: API: Add Asset Price to Episode Steps Endpoint

## 1. Description

The current `/api/v1/episodes/{episode_id}/steps/` endpoint returns step data including `portfolio_value`, `reward`, and `action`, but crucially lacks the underlying asset's price (e.g., the closing price of the traded instrument like SPY) at that specific timestamp.

This missing data prevents accurate calculation of decision analysis metrics in the dashboard (see `TASK-BACKEND-20250505-211848`), as metrics like "Buy on Price Up" or "Sell in Downtrend" are currently forced to rely on `portfolio_value` changes, which is suboptimal.

This task is to modify the API endpoint and its underlying logic to include the relevant asset price in the response for each step.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

*   Identify the source of the asset price data corresponding to each step's timestamp within the backend system (likely available during simulation/training data generation or accessible via `db_models`).
*   Modify the Pydantic schema (`reinforcestrategycreator/api/schemas/episodes.py` -> `StepSchema` or similar) to include a new field, e.g., `asset_price: float`.
*   Update the API endpoint logic (`reinforcestrategycreator/api/routers/episodes.py` -> relevant steps endpoint function) to retrieve and include the `asset_price` in the data returned for each step.
*   Ensure the change is backwards compatible if necessary, or clearly document the new required field.
*   Add or update unit/integration tests for the endpoint to verify the presence and correctness of the `asset_price` field.
*   Update API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI spec) if applicable.

## 3. Checklist

*   [ ] Identify data source for asset price per step. (Requires backend changes/investigation - see TASK-BACKEND-20250505-211848)
*   [‚úÖ] Update `StepSchema` in `reinforcestrategycreator/api/schemas/episodes.py` with `asset_price`.
*   [‚úÖ] Update endpoint logic in `reinforcestrategycreator/api/routers/episodes.py` to fetch and return `asset_price`. (No code change needed due to `from_attributes=True` in schema and updated DB model)
*   [‚ö†Ô∏è Skipped] Verify data retrieval and inclusion logic. (DB empty, test skipped due to missing fixture).
*   [‚úÖ] Add test file tests/test_api_episodes.py (test skipped due to missing fixture).
*   [‚úÖ] Update API documentation if needed. (No change needed).
*   [‚ö†Ô∏è Skipped] Test the endpoint manually (e.g., via Swagger UI or `curl`). (DB empty).

## 4. Implementation Notes & Logs

*   **2025-05-05 21:22:** Updated `schemas.Step` in `api/schemas/episodes.py` to include optional `asset_price: float | None`.
*   **2025-05-05 21:23:** Endpoint logic update (`api/routers/episodes.py`) was blocked pending DB model update.
*   **2025-05-05 21:25:** Confirmed DB model updated (`TASK-DB-20250505-212500`). Router logic requires no explicit change due to `from_attributes=True`.
*   **2025-05-05 21:28:** Manual test (`curl`) failed with 500 Internal Server Error. Traceback indicates `sqlalchemy.exc.ProgrammingError: (psycopg2.errors.UndefinedColumn) column steps.asset_price does not exist`. The database schema (`steps` table) was not updated to match the model change from `TASK-DB-20250505-212500`. `init_db.py` uses `create_all`, which does not alter existing tables. API work is blocked until the database schema is updated (e.g., via `ALTER TABLE` or a migration tool).
*   **2025-05-05 21:31:** Retried manual test (`curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/episodes/106/steps/" -H "accept: application/json" -H "X-API-Key: test-key-123"`) after reported DB schema update (`TASK-API-20250505-213000`). Still received 500 Internal Server Error with the same `psycopg2.errors.UndefinedColumn: column steps.asset_price does not exist` error. The database schema update was likely ineffective because `create_all` doesn't modify existing tables. Task remains blocked.
*   **2025-05-05 21:34:** Retry attempt after DB confirmed dropped/recreated (`TASK-API-20250505-213300`). Manual test (`curl`) failed with 404 as test episode ID 106 no longer exists. Subsequent `curl` to list IDs (`/api/v1/episodes/ids`) returned empty list `[]`. Cannot manually verify `asset_price` inclusion. Added test file `tests/test_api_episodes.py`. Test run skipped due to missing DB fixture. API code changes are complete, but verification requires test data and/or fixture setup.
