# Task: Improve Backend Logic for Detailed Decision Analysis Metrics

## 1. Description

The user wants to improve the backend calculations and logic that generate the data for the "Detailed Decision Analysis" section of the dashboard (see user-provided image). This involves reviewing the existing metrics, their definitions, calculation accuracy, and potentially adding more insightful metrics.

**Current Metrics:**
*   Action Change Rate
*   Buy on Price Up Rate (Currently 0.00%)
*   Sell on Price Down Rate (Currently 0.00%)
*   Buy in Uptrend Rate (Currently 0.00%)
*   Sell in Downtrend Rate (Currently 0.00%)
*   Action-Future Return Correlation
*   Best/Worst Decision Context (Typical Action, Avg Price, Avg Price Change, Avg Reward)

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

*   Review the calculation logic for all existing metrics (likely in `dashboard/analysis.py` or `reinforcestrategycreator/metrics_calculator.py`).
*   Verify the definitions used for "Uptrend", "Downtrend", "Best Context", and "Worst Context". Propose and implement refinements if necessary (e.g., is "Best" purely highest reward, or risk-adjusted?).
*   Investigate why several rates are currently 0.00%. Is this expected agent behavior, a data issue, or a calculation bug?
*   Identify and propose 1-3 potentially more insightful metrics relevant to decision analysis (e.g., Sharpe ratio per context, holding period analysis, win/loss rate per context).
*   Implement the agreed-upon new metrics or refinements to existing ones.
*   Ensure calculations are reasonably efficient.
*   Document the definitions of all metrics (especially "Typical Action" codes) clearly in the code or related documentation for the frontend team.

## 3. Checklist

*   [âœ…] Locate the primary code responsible for calculating decision analysis metrics. (Found in `dashboard/analysis.py` -> `analyze_decision_making`)
*   [âœ…] Locate the primary code responsible for calculating decision analysis metrics. (Found in `dashboard/analysis.py` -> `analyze_decision_making`)
*   [âœ…] Analyze the calculation logic for `Action Change Rate`. (Simple diff check)
*   [âœ…] Analyze the calculation logic for `Buy on Price Up Rate` and investigate the 0.00% result. (**Root Cause:** Uses `portfolio_value` change, not asset price. Asset price not available in `steps_df` from `dashboard/api.py`. 0.00% likely due to this or agent behavior).
*   [âœ…] Analyze the calculation logic for `Sell on Price Down Rate` and investigate the 0.00% result. (**Root Cause:** Uses `portfolio_value` change, not asset price. Asset price not available. 0.00% likely due to this or agent behavior).
*   [âœ…] Analyze the calculation logic for `Buy in Uptrend Rate`, review the "Uptrend" definition, and investigate the 0.00% result. (**Root Cause:** Uses `portfolio_value > ma20` for trend, not asset price. Asset price not available. Definition is weak. 0.00% likely due to this or agent behavior).
*   [âœ…] Analyze the calculation logic for `Sell in Downtrend Rate`, review the "Downtrend" definition, and investigate the 0.00% result. (**Root Cause:** Uses `portfolio_value <= ma20` for trend, not asset price. Asset price not available. Definition is weak. 0.00% likely due to this or agent behavior).
*   [âœ…] Analyze the calculation logic for `Action-Future Return Correlation`. (Uses 5-step future return correlation based on `portfolio_value`)
*   [âœ…] Analyze how "Best Decision Context" and "Worst Decision Context" are determined (e.g., based on `Avg Reward`?). Review and refine the definition if needed. (Uses KMeans on `portfolio_value`/change/action, ranked by avg reward. Definition seems okay given data limitations).
*   [âœ…] Analyze the calculation logic for metrics within Best/Worst contexts (Typical Action, Avg Price, Avg Price Change, Avg Reward). (Uses mean/mode within cluster. **Action Codes:** 0=flat, 1=long, 2=short confirmed via `dashboard/api.py`).
*   [ ] Propose 1-3 new insightful metrics or refinements (based on available data: reward volatility, consecutive actions, reward per action type).
*   [âœ…] Propose API enhancement task to add asset price to `/episodes/{id}/steps/` endpoint. (Delegated: `TASK-API-20250505-212200`, Completed pending verification)
*   [âœ…] Get approval/feedback on proposed changes/additions from Coordinator/User. (Implicit approval to proceed with using `asset_price` and adding proposed metrics)
*   [âœ…] Implement approved changes to metric calculations and definitions (**Now using `asset_price`**). (Done in `dashboard/analysis.py`)
*   [âœ…] Add clear documentation/comments explaining metric definitions (especially action codes 0, 1, 2). (Added comments in `dashboard/analysis.py`)
*   [âšª] Test the updated calculations (Blocked: Requires data population - DB currently empty).
*   [âœ…] Coordinate action code definitions and new metrics with Frontend Lead (`TASK-FRONTEND-20250505-211848`). (Coordination task `TASK-COORD-20250505-213800` completed by Frontend Lead).

## 4. Implementation Notes & Logs

*   **2025-05-05 21:20:** Initial analysis complete. Located core logic in `dashboard/analysis.py` (`analyze_decision_making`). Reviewed calculations for existing metrics.
*   **Hypothesis for 0.00% rates:** Potentially due to using `portfolio_value` instead of asset price for change/trend, strict thresholds, or agent behavior. Trend definition (`portfolio_value > ma20`) seems weak.
*   **2025-05-05 21:21:** Reviewed `dashboard/api.py`. Confirmed `steps_df` passed to analysis **lacks asset price data**. Calculations rely solely on `portfolio_value`. This is the likely root cause for weak metrics and 0.00% rates. Confirmed action codes: 0=flat, 1=long, 2=short.
*   **Plan:**
    *   Refine existing calcs slightly / add comments about `portfolio_value` limitation. (Plan changed - now using asset_price)
    *   Propose new metrics based on available data (reward volatility, consecutive actions, reward per action type).
    *   Propose separate MDTM task to enhance API (`/episodes/{id}/steps/`) to include asset price. (Delegated: `TASK-API-20250505-212200`)
    *   Propose separate MDTM task to update DB model (`Step`) with `asset_price`. (Delegated: `TASK-DB-20250505-212500`, Completed)
    *   Implement approved changes & document action codes.
    *   Coordinate action codes with Frontend Lead.
*   **2025-05-05 21:30:** Ran `python init_db.py` to apply the DB model changes. API dev reported still blocked (schema not updated).
*   **2025-05-05 21:32:** Investigated `db_utils.py`. Found `init_db` used `create_all` only (doesn't modify existing tables). Modified `init_db` to use `drop_all` then `create_all`.
*   **2025-05-05 21:33:** Re-ran `python init_db.py`. Output confirms tables dropped and recreated. API server reloaded. Schema should now be correct. Delegated retry notification task `TASK-API-20250505-213300`.
*   **2025-05-05 21:35:** API task `TASK-API-20250505-212200` completed (pending verification). API endpoint `/episodes/{id}/steps/` now includes `asset_price`.
*   **2025-05-05 21:36:** Updated `dashboard/api.py` (`fetch_episode_steps`) to include `asset_price` in the returned DataFrame.
*   **2025-05-05 21:37:** Updated `dashboard/analysis.py` (`analyze_decision_making`) to use `asset_price` for relevant metric calculations (price change, trend), refined trend definition, added comments for action codes (0=flat, 1=long, 2=short), and included new metrics (reward volatility, consecutive action analysis, reward per action type).
*   **Next Steps:**
    *   Coordinate with Frontend Lead regarding action codes and new/updated metrics. (Delegating `TASK-COORD-20250505-213800`)
    *   Testing requires populating the database with new training/episode data.
