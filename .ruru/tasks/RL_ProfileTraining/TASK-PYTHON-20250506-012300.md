# Profile train.py to Identify Performance Bottlenecks

## 1. Description

Despite installing `tensorflow-metal` and adding device checks, the training process (`train.py`) is reported as slow with low system load, suggesting potential bottlenecks beyond GPU utilization (or lack thereof).

This task requires profiling the `train.py` script to identify which parts of the code are consuming the most execution time. This will help pinpoint areas for optimization.

Use Python's built-in `cProfile` module or another suitable profiling tool (like `py-spy` if appropriate and installable) to analyze the execution of `train.py` for a limited number of steps or episodes.

Focus on identifying time spent in:
*   Data loading/preprocessing (`data_fetcher.py`, environment reset).
*   Feature calculation (`technical_analyzer.py`).
*   Environment stepping (`trading_environment.py`'s `step` method).
*   Agent learning (`rl_agent.py`'s `learn` method, including model predictions and fitting).
*   Replay buffer operations (`rl_agent.py`'s `remember`, `learn`).

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

*   The `train.py` script is executed with a profiler enabled for a representative duration (e.g., one or two episodes).
*   The profiler output (e.g., stats file from `cProfile`) is generated.
*   The profiler output is analyzed to identify the top functions/methods consuming the most time.
*   A summary of the profiling results, highlighting the key bottlenecks, is documented.
*   Recommendations for specific optimization targets based on the profiling results are provided.
*   Findings and recommendations are documented in this task file.

## 3. Checklist

*   [‚úÖ] Choose a profiling method (`cProfile`, `line_profiler`, `py-spy`, etc.). (Used `cProfile`)
*   [‚úÖ] Modify `train.py` or create a wrapper script to run the training under the profiler for a limited duration (e.g., modify `NUM_EPISODES` or add step limit). (Set `TRAINING_EPISODES = 1`)
*   [‚úÖ] Execute the profiled training run using `poetry run`.
*   [‚úÖ] Save or capture the profiler output. (Saved to `train_profile.prof`)
*   [‚úÖ] Analyze the profiler output (e.g., using `pstats` for `cProfile`). (Used `analyze_profile.py`)
*   [‚úÖ] Identify the top time-consuming functions/operations.
*   [‚úÖ] Document the profiling results and identified bottlenecks. (See Logs/Notes)
*   [‚úÖ] Formulate optimization recommendations based on the findings. (See Logs/Notes)
*   [‚úÖ] Commit any necessary helper/wrapper scripts if created. (`analyze_profile.py` created, can be committed or removed)

## 4. Logs / Notes

**Profiling Command:**
```bash
poetry run python -m cProfile -o train_profile.prof train.py
```
(Note: `train.py` was temporarily modified to run only 1 episode)

**Analysis Script (`analyze_profile.py`):**
```python
import pstats
import sys

profile_file = "train_profile.prof"
output_limit = 20

try:
    stats = pstats.Stats(profile_file)
    print(f"--- Top {output_limit} functions by cumulative time (cumtime) ---")
    stats.sort_stats('cumulative').print_stats(output_limit)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: Profile file '{profile_file}' not found.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred while analyzing the profile: {e}")
```

**Profiling Results Summary:**

The profiling run (1 episode) took approximately 103 seconds. The analysis revealed the following:

*   **Dominant Bottleneck:** The vast majority of time (~45.8s cumulative) is spent within TensorFlow's core execution function (`TFE_Py_FastPathExecute`). This indicates that the primary computational load comes from the DQN agent's model training (`agent.learn()`) and prediction (`agent.select_action()`) steps, which is expected for a deep learning task.
*   **TensorFlow/Keras Internals:** Significant time is also spent within various TensorFlow/Keras internal functions related to data iteration (`builtins.next` driven by Keras iterators), graph execution, and tensor operations.
*   **NumPy Conversion:** Converting TensorFlow tensors to NumPy arrays (`_numpy_internal`) accounts for ~3.1s.
*   **Other Components:** Data loading/preprocessing, feature calculation, environment stepping, and database logging did *not* appear as significant bottlenecks in this short profiling run compared to the core TensorFlow operations.

**Optimization Recommendations:**

Given that the bottleneck is within the core TensorFlow operations (model training/prediction):

1.  **Model Complexity:** Review the DQN model architecture (`StrategyAgent`). If it's overly complex for the task, simplifying it (fewer layers, smaller layers) could reduce computation time.
2.  **Batch Size:** Experiment with the `AGENT_BATCH_SIZE`. A larger batch size might improve GPU utilization but could slow down learning per update. A smaller batch size might lead to faster updates but potentially less stable learning. Finding the optimal balance is key.
3.  **Mixed Precision:** If not already enabled, consider using TensorFlow's mixed precision training (`tf.keras.mixed_precision.set_global_policy('mixed_float16')`). This can significantly speed up training on compatible GPUs (like the M4 Max) with minimal impact on accuracy. *Requires careful testing.*
4.  **TensorFlow Performance Tuning:** Explore TensorFlow's performance guide for more advanced techniques like optimizing data input pipelines (`tf.data`), using `tf.function` effectively (already likely used by Keras), and potentially XLA compilation (though this can be complex).
5.  **Reduce NumPy Conversions:** Analyze where `.numpy()` calls occur (e.g., in `agent.remember`, `env.step` info processing). If frequent conversions between TF tensors and NumPy arrays happen within tight loops, try to keep operations within the TensorFlow graph/eager execution context as much as possible.
6.  **Hardware Utilization:** Although `tensorflow-metal` is installed and the GPU is detected, the initial report mentioned low system load. Double-check GPU utilization during a longer training run using system monitoring tools (like `asitop` on macOS) to confirm if the GPU is truly the bottleneck or if there are other limiting factors (e.g., data pipeline stalls not captured prominently in this short profile). The profile suggests TF execution *is* the main time sink, but verifying hardware usage is still valuable.

**Next Steps:** Focus on TensorFlow/Keras optimizations (Mixed Precision, Batch Size, Model Complexity) as the most promising avenues based on this profile.
