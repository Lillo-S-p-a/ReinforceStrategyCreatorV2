# Create Session Log and Artifact Structure

## Overview / Purpose üéØ

This task is to create the necessary directory structure and initial log file for a new user session.

## Content Section 1: Instructions üìù

1.  [‚úÖ] **Create Session Directory**:
    *   Create the directory: `.ruru/sessions/SESSION-AnalyzeDocTestModelSelectionPy-2505281202/`
    *   Ensure all parent directories are created if they don't exist.

2.  [‚úÖ] **Copy Artifact Scaffold**:
    *   The session artifact scaffold directory is located at `.ruru/templates/session_artifact_scaffold/`.
    *   Copy the *entire contents* of this scaffold directory into the newly created session's `artifacts/` subdirectory.
    *   The command should be equivalent to: `mkdir -p .ruru/sessions/SESSION-AnalyzeDocTestModelSelectionPy-2505281202/artifacts/ && cp -r .ruru/templates/session_artifact_scaffold/. .ruru/sessions/SESSION-AnalyzeDocTestModelSelectionPy-2505281202/artifacts/`
    *   Verify that all subdirectories (notes, learnings, etc.) and their `README.md` files are copied into `.ruru/sessions/SESSION-AnalyzeDocTestModelSelectionPy-2505281202/artifacts/`.

3.  [‚úÖ] **Create Session Log File**:
    *   Create the file: `.ruru/sessions/SESSION-AnalyzeDocTestModelSelectionPy-2505281202/session_log.md`
    *   The content for this file is provided below:

# Session Log V7

*This section is primarily for **append-only** logging of significant events by the Coordinator and involved modes.*
*Refer to `.ruru/docs/standards/session_artifact_guidelines_v1.md` for artifact types and naming.*

## Log Entries

- [2025-05-28 12:02:30] Session initiated by `roo-commander` with goal: "Analyze and document test_model_selection_improvements.py script"
```

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   The directory `.ruru/sessions/SESSION-AnalyzeDocTestModelSelectionPy-2505281202/` exists.
*   The directory `.ruru/sessions/SESSION-AnalyzeDocTestModelSelectionPy-2505281202/artifacts/` exists and contains all subdirectories and README files from `.ruru/templates/session_artifact_scaffold/`.
*   The file `.ruru/sessions/SESSION-AnalyzeDocTestModelSelectionPy-2505281202/session_log.md` exists and contains the exact content specified above.
