# Task: Implement Technical Analyzer (RSI, MACD, BBands)

## 1. Description üìù

Implement the functionality to calculate standard technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) using the input OHLCV data, as specified in requirement FR2. This component will enrich the raw market data with features needed by the RL agent.

## 2. Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

*   [‚úÖ] A function/method (e.g., `add_indicators`) exists in `reinforcestrategycreator/technical_analyzer.py` that takes a pandas DataFrame with OHLCV columns as input.
*   [‚úÖ] The function calculates RSI using a standard period (e.g., 14).
*   [‚úÖ] The function calculates MACD, including the MACD line, signal line, and histogram, using standard periods (e.g., 12, 26, 9).
*   [‚úÖ] The function calculates Bollinger Bands (upper, middle, lower) using a standard period (e.g., 20) and standard deviation (e.g., 2).
*   [‚úÖ] The calculated indicator values are added as new columns to the input DataFrame (preferred) or returned alongside the original data. Column names should be clear (e.g., `RSI_14`, `MACD_12_26_9`, `MACDs_12_26_9`, `MACDh_12_26_9`, `BBL_20_2`, `BBM_20_2`, `BBU_20_2`).
*   [‚úÖ] Address initial NaN values resulting from indicator calculations (e.g., ensure they remain NaN, as the environment might handle them).
*   [‚úÖ] Add unit tests to `tests/test_technical_analyzer.py`:
    *   [‚úÖ] Test indicator calculations on a sample DataFrame. Verify output values (potentially compare against direct library calls or known results).
    *   [‚úÖ] Test handling of edge cases if applicable (e.g., insufficient data for calculation).

## 3. Implementation Details üõ†Ô∏è

*   Utilize the `pandas-ta` or `ta` library (both are listed in `pyproject.toml`). `pandas-ta` often integrates more directly with DataFrames.
*   Modify the existing `TechnicalAnalyzer` class or relevant functions within `reinforcestrategycreator/technical_analyzer.py`.
*   Ensure the function modifies the DataFrame in place or returns a new DataFrame as decided.

## 4. Checklist ü™ú

*   [‚úÖ] Implement RSI calculation.
*   [‚úÖ] Implement MACD calculation (line, signal, histogram).
*   [‚úÖ] Implement Bollinger Bands calculation (upper, middle, lower).
*   [‚úÖ] Integrate calculations into a primary function/method in `technical_analyzer.py`.
*   [‚úÖ] Handle NaN values appropriately.
*   [‚úÖ] Write unit tests for the indicator calculations in `tests/test_technical_analyzer.py`.
*   [‚úÖ] Ensure tests pass.
*   [ ] Update `docs/requirements.md` to mark FR2.1, FR2.2, FR2.3 as implemented (or in progress).
