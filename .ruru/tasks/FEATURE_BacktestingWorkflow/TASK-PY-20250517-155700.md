# Fix TechnicalAnalyzer compatibility issue in backtesting module

## Description

We've identified another compatibility issue in the refactored backtesting module. In `reinforcestrategycreator/backtesting/data.py`, there's code that tries to import and use a `TechnicalAnalyzer` class with an `add_all_indicators` method:

```python
from reinforcestrategycreator.technical_analyzer import TechnicalAnalyzer
# ...
analyzer = TechnicalAnalyzer()
data = analyzer.add_all_indicators(data)
```

However, examining `reinforcestrategycreator/technical_analyzer.py` reveals there is no such class - instead, there's a function called `calculate_indicators(data)` that performs the technical indicator calculations.

This is similar to the previous compatibility issue we resolved with `RLAgent` vs. `StrategyAgent`, and requires a similar solution.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [‚úÖ] Fix the inconsistency between the `TechnicalAnalyzer` class reference in `backtesting/data.py` and the actual function-based implementation in `technical_analyzer.py`
- [‚úÖ] Update imports and usage in `backtesting/data.py` to correctly use the technical analysis functionality
- [‚úÖ] Ensure the solution maintains backward compatibility
- [‚úÖ] Document the changes made in the task update
- [‚úÖ] Verify that the backtesting functionality works correctly with the fix

## Technical Notes

There are two possible approaches:
1. Update `backtesting/data.py` to directly use the `calculate_indicators` function
2. Create a backward-compatibility class wrapper for `calculate_indicators` in `technical_analyzer.py` named `TechnicalAnalyzer` with an `add_all_indicators` method

The test file `tests/test_technical_analyzer.py` confirms that the intended design is function-based, not class-based, which suggests approach #1 may be more aligned with the codebase design.

## Files to Modify

- `reinforcestrategycreator/backtesting/data.py` - Update import and usage
- `reinforcestrategycreator/technical_analyzer.py` - If implementing approach #2 (compatibility class)

## Log

- 2025-05-17 15:57: Task created by Roo Commander
- 2025-05-17 16:00: Task completed by Python Developer. Implemented a backward-compatibility class wrapper for `calculate_indicators` in `technical_analyzer.py`. Added a `TechnicalAnalyzer` class with an `add_all_indicators` method that calls the existing `calculate_indicators` function. This approach maintains backward compatibility with the existing code in `backtesting/data.py` while preserving the function-based design of the technical analyzer module. Verified the solution with a test script that confirms both approaches produce identical results.
- 2025-05-17 16:01: Task verified by Roo Commander. The implemented solution appropriately addresses the compatibility issue by providing a clean wrapper class that maintains backward compatibility while preserving the function-based design. This completes all backtesting module compatibility fixes identified so far.
