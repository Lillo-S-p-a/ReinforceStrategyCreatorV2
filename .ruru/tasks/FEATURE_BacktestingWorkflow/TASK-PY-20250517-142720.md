# Complete Remaining Methods for Backtesting Workflow

## Description

This subtask focuses on implementing the remaining methods needed to complete the `BacktestingWorkflow` class in `backtesting_workflow.py`. Several methods have already been implemented, but we need to add the final methods to complete the workflow.

## Background Context

The `backtesting_workflow.py` file already contains implementations for:
- Data fetching and preparation
- Cross-validation framework
- Model training and evaluation for individual folds
- Best model selection
- Final model training and evaluation
- Benchmark comparison
- Various visualization methods

However, we still need to implement the remaining critical methods to make the workflow fully functional.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Implement all remaining methods of the `BacktestingWorkflow` class
2. Ensure consistent coding style with existing methods
3. Add comprehensive docstrings and comments
4. Implement proper error handling

## Implementation Checklist

- [âœ…] Implement `generate_report()` - For creating a comprehensive backtesting report
- [âœ…] Implement `export_for_trading()` - For exporting the model for paper/live trading
- [âœ…] Implement `run_workflow()` - Main method that orchestrates the entire workflow process
- [âœ…] Add comprehensive docstrings and comments
- [âœ…] Ensure proper error handling throughout

## Required Method Details

1. `generate_report()`:
   - Should create a comprehensive report of all backtesting results
   - Include key metrics, comparisons, and visualizations
   - Save as HTML, PDF, or Markdown format

2. `export_for_trading()`:
   - Export the final trained model in a format suitable for paper/live trading
   - Include relevant metadata and configuration
   - Ensure compatibility with existing trading infrastructure

3. `run_workflow()`:
   - Orchestrate the complete backtesting process
   - Call other methods in the appropriate sequence
   - Include progress tracking and logging
   - Handle exceptions and provide clear error messages

## File Structure

The implementation should be added to the existing `backtesting_workflow.py` file.
