# Refactor Backtesting Workflow into Modular Package Structure

## Description

The current implementation of `backtesting_workflow.py` is very large (over 1200 lines) and has become difficult to manage and maintain. This task involves refactoring the existing monolithic implementation into a proper modular package structure with clear separation of concerns.

## Background Context

The `backtesting_workflow.py` file currently implements a comprehensive backtesting workflow for reinforcement learning trading strategies. It includes functionality for:
- Data preparation
- Cross-validation
- Model training and selection
- Evaluation and benchmark comparison
- Visualization
- Report generation
- Model export

All of these concerns are currently in a single large file, making it difficult to maintain, test, and extend.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Reorganize the code into a proper Python package structure with appropriate submodules
2. Maintain all existing functionality while improving code organization
3. Ensure proper modular design with clear interfaces between modules
4. Preserve all docstrings and maintain or improve code documentation
5. Implement proper imports between modules
6. Ensure the refactored code follows Python best practices for package structure
7. Maintain backward compatibility so existing code using the `BacktestingWorkflow` class continues to work

## Implementation Checklist

- [✅] Create a package structure (e.g., `reinforcestrategycreator/backtesting/`)
- [✅] Define appropriate submodules based on functional areas
- [✅] Implement a main workflow class that orchestrates the modules
- [✅] Refactor data preparation functionality into its own module
- [✅] Refactor cross-validation functionality into its own module
- [✅] Refactor model training and selection into its own module
- [✅] Refactor evaluation and benchmarking into its own module
- [✅] Refactor visualization into its own module
- [✅] Refactor reporting into its own module
- [✅] Refactor model export into its own module
- [✅] Ensure proper imports and connections between modules
- [✅] Create appropriate `__init__.py` files with proper exports
- [✅] Implement backward compatibility layer if needed

## Suggested Module Structure

```
reinforcestrategycreator/backtesting/
├── __init__.py            # Main exports and backward compatibility
├── workflow.py            # Main workflow orchestration
├── data.py                # Data fetching and preparation
├── cross_validation.py    # Cross-validation implementation
├── model.py               # Model training and selection
├── evaluation.py          # Evaluation and metrics calculation
├── benchmarks.py          # Benchmark strategy implementations
├── visualization.py       # Plotting and visualization
├── reporting.py           # Report generation (HTML, Markdown, PDF)
└── export.py              # Model export functionality
```

## Additional Notes

- Each module should have a clear responsibility and focus
- Consider using classes where appropriate to encapsulate state and behavior
- Ensure proper error handling and logging in each module
- The main `workflow.py` module should primarily orchestrate other modules rather than implementing detailed functionality
- The public API should remain largely unchanged to maintain backward compatibility
