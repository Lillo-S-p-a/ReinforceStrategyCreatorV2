# Implement Comprehensive Backtesting Workflow for RL Trading Strategy

## Description

This task involves developing a comprehensive backtesting workflow for a reinforcement learning trading strategy system. The workflow should integrate existing functionality from `hyperparameter_optimization.py` and `model_evaluation.py` while extending it to provide a robust, reproducible backtesting framework.

The implementation should follow a class-based approach with the `BacktestingWorkflow` class implementing the entire workflow, from data preparation through cross-validation, hyperparameter optimization, model selection, final evaluation, benchmark comparison, and results visualization.

## Background Context

The existing codebase includes components for hyperparameter optimization and model evaluation, but lacks an integrated workflow that connects these pieces while adding robust cross-validation and detailed result analysis. This implementation aims to create a standardized, reproducible approach to backtesting reinforcement learning trading strategies.

Key components of the codebase include:
- A reinforcement learning agent for trading (`reinforcestrategycreator/rl_agent.py`)
- A trading environment (`reinforcestrategycreator/trading_environment.py`)
- Data fetching utilities (`reinforcestrategycreator/data_fetcher.py`) 
- Technical analysis tools (`reinforcestrategycreator/technical_analyzer.py`)
- Database integration for logging results (`reinforcestrategycreator/db_models.py`)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Implement a complete `BacktestingWorkflow` class that handles the entire backtesting process
2. Incorporate time-series cross-validation for robust performance evaluation
3. Integrate hyperparameter optimization using Ray Tune
4. Implement detailed results visualization with matplotlib 
5. Add benchmark comparison against standard trading strategies
6. Include proper logging, error handling, and progress tracking
7. Create clear, comprehensive documentation within the code
8. Ensure all methods follow a consistent API and naming convention

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Implement core BacktestingWorkflow class structure and initialization
- [ ] Implement data fetching and preparation with technical indicators
- [ ] Implement time-series cross-validation framework
- [ ] Implement hyperparameter optimization integration
- [ ] Implement cross-validation summary and visualization methods
- [ ] Implement best model selection logic
- [ ] Implement final model training on full dataset
- [ ] Implement test set evaluation
- [ ] Implement benchmark comparison functionality
- [ ] Implement test results visualization
- [âœ…] Implement report generation
- [âœ…] Implement model export for trading
- [âœ…] Implement complete workflow orchestration method
- [âœ…] Add comprehensive docstrings and comments
- [âœ…] Ensure proper error handling throughout

## File Structure

The primary implementation should be in `backtesting_workflow.py` in the root directory.

## Required Methods

The BacktestingWorkflow class should include (but not be limited to) the following methods:

1. Core functionality:
   - `__init__` - Initialize workflow with configuration
   - `fetch_data` - Fetch and prepare data with technical indicators
   - `perform_cross_validation` - Execute time-series cross-validation
   - `select_best_model` - Select best hyperparameter configuration
   - `train_final_model` - Train final model on complete dataset
   - `evaluate_final_model` - Evaluate on test data
   - `generate_report` - Generate comprehensive backtesting report
   - `export_for_trading` - Export model for paper/live trading
   - `run_workflow` - Main method to run the complete workflow

2. Helper methods:
   - `_train_evaluate_fold` - Train and evaluate for a single CV fold
   - `_get_episode_metrics` - Calculate key episode metrics
   - `_evaluate_on_validation` - Evaluate model on validation data
   - `_visualize_fold_results` - Create visualizations for each fold
   - `_save_cv_summary` - Save cross-validation summary data
   - `_create_cv_comparison_plot` - Create comparison plot across folds
   - `_compare_with_benchmarks` - Compare with baseline strategies
   - `_save_test_results` - Save test evaluation results
   - `_visualize_test_results` - Create test results visualizations

## Resources and References

- Current implementation in `backtesting_workflow.py`
- Hyperparameter optimization logic in `hyperparameter_optimization.py`
- Evaluation methods in `model_evaluation.py`
- Trading system components in the `reinforcestrategycreator` package

## Additional Notes

- Consider using a parameter grid for hyperparameter optimization that includes learning rate, network architecture, reward scaling, and other key parameters
- The code should be flexible enough to work with different asset types and timeframes
- Progress should be logged clearly throughout the workflow execution
- Error handling should be robust and informative
