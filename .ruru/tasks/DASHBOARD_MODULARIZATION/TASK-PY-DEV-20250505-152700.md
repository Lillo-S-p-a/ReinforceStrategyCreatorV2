# Dashboard Modularization Task

## Description

We've begun modularizing the RL trading dashboard (currently in `dashboard_enhanced_v2.py`) to address issues and make it more maintainable. The basic module structure has been created in the `dashboard/` directory with:

1. `__init__.py` - Package initialization
2. `api.py` - API interaction functions
3. `analysis.py` - Analysis functions

Your task is to complete the modularization by:

1. Creating the remaining modules:
   - `visualization.py` - Plotting functions
   - `utils.py` - Helper functions (like `format_metric`)
   - `model_management.py` - Model saving/loading functions 
   - `main.py` - Main Streamlit application

2. Fix a critical bug we identified in the original code where string actions were causing errors in numerical operations. The bug has been fixed in `api.py` by adding:
   ```python
   # Ensure action is numeric for calculations
   df['action'] = pd.to_numeric(df['action'], errors='coerce')
   ```

## Implementation Details

### 1. `visualization.py`
Extract all plotting functions from the original code, including:
- `create_price_operations_chart`
- `create_drawdown_chart`
- `create_trade_analysis_charts`
- `create_action_analysis`
- `create_reward_analysis`
- `create_model_parameter_radar`

### 2. `utils.py`
Extract helper functions including:
- `format_metric`
- Any other utility functions that aren't specific to API, analysis, or visualization

### 3. `model_management.py`
Extract model management functions:
- `save_model_to_production`
- `get_saved_production_models`

### 4. `main.py`
Create the main Streamlit application that imports and uses the other modules.
- Define constants at the top
- Structure the application with proper sections
- Import functions from the other modules

## Dependencies
- streamlit
- pandas
- numpy
- plotly
- scikit-learn
- requests

## Testing

The dashboard should run with:
```bash
streamlit run dashboard/main.py
```

Verify the dashboard works and fixes the previous bugs, especially the action type issue that was crashing the analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [  ] All modules created with proper imports and dependencies
- [  ] Dashboard runs without errors or type conversion issues
- [  ] All original functionality preserved
- [  ] Code is properly documented
- [  ] codebase is now more maintainable and modular

## Notes
- Ensure the action column is properly converted to numeric in *all* relevant analysis functions, not just in the API data fetching
- The dashboard should have identical UI/UX as the original version
- Code structure should follow Python best practices for modular applications
